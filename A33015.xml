            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving by a ſtrange fortune lighted on this Book, which to me appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo pleaſing, and fit for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, in that your retired ſolitary life; I think it cannot be diſpleaſing to any, being raiſed with the glory of your Name: that is, this Hiſtory of <hi>Eliſe.</hi> In which, Madam, you ſhall find Vertue ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the weight of afflictions, that end it; and an innocence made guilty more by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencie of the Parties, then the malice of the Judges.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be eſteemed a Tragick hiſtory not ſo fit for your perſent diſpoſition, to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:98576:3"/>
ought to be preſented but of pleaſure and content. But to judg ſo, is to be ignorant of your worth, which like the Dolphin is moſt pleaſed in the rougheſt waters. And as nothing gives more content to thoſe that have paſſed dangers, then to ſpeak of the perils they have been in both by ſea and land; who can better judge then you, that have found by experience the truth of this ſaying of a grave Writer, That it is very hard amongſt ſo much malignity as hath infected the world, to live under the ſupport of innocence. But when poſterity ſhal read your hiſtory, which deſerves the writing of the moſt able and curious pen, they will then hold for a vanity that of the Romans, which is a truth in your hiſtory, that hath ſhewed us a vertue without ſecond, in the firſt and moſt glorious from of our dayes; One may ſee a patience without example, a mildneſs unbelievable, a fidelity inviolable, a chaſtity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, and laſtly a conſtancie founded on emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent piety, that can know nothing greater then it ſelf.</p>
            <p>All this, Madam, is exempt from flattery; ſince as many places as the Sun ſhines on, are as many Eccho's of your praiſes. But what eccho's or what voice can worthily ſhew your merits, being raiſed to that height, that they can no way be preſented but imperfectly; none can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take without expreſs boldneſs, were they never ſo eloquent in language, to praiſe them but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly. But as our eys have a natural ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie with the elements of fire and water, which proceeds from their compoſition, and make us

willingly contemplate the bright livelineſs of the one, and the chryſtal running of the other: Even ſo I hope, be it that your eys deſcend to the reading of this Peece, or that your ears may but hear it recited, your thoughts may meet with conſolation; ſeeing in the misfortunes of others a feeble Idea of theſe diſaſters, whoſe blackneſs will raiſe the height of your glories, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the Night ſets off the brightneſs of the Moon, whoſe roundneſs is accompliſhed. It is for weak ſpirits to faint at ſight of one let blood; Generous hearts laugh at the attaints of fortune; and how can they look pale at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of calamities, that have ſo far ſurmounted the greateſt? And then, Madam, the honour you have gained in bringing to the world ſo many Males for the maintaining of the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Noble houſe of the <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Which hath no other end but to bring you ſome divertiſement and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to let you ſee the lively affection I have ever had to honour and eſteem, according to my power, ſo many Vertues as crown you, and tie me, Madam, to be ever</p>

            <p>THe little time I lived in <hi>France,</hi> and the ſmall skill I attained in the language, ſhould have diverted me from the undertaking of a Tranſtation: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent I took in the reading of this Tragick Hiſtory of <hi>Eliza,</hi> made me rather venture the cenſure of Detractors, then not to publiſh a Story of ſo much pitty and example. In which thou ſhalt ſee, that ſuffering is not always for the offenders, as for the unfortunate; and that want of Conſideration is many times cauſe of as great accidents as Malice. It will teach thee to fear God, and to think of thy ways, that is, to govern thy actions with wiſdom and circumſpection.</p>
            <p>Love and Death are the two principal Actors in this Scene, and as in an Embleme they change their from. Thou wilt ſee ſtrange effects of both the one and the other: For certainly it is very hard in this lamentable Age in which we live, as in that of the Prophet; and it may be ſaid after him, That Murder and Adultery make a prodigious inundation over the face of the earth and that blood craves blood Who hath ever heard that true Love was inconſiſtent with piety? For truly, the profane and the vertuous cannot be joyned with devotion, as thoſe that be governed by wiſdom and diſcretion. As the contrary I know by its oppoſite; even ſo how can I make known the beauty of the one, if I ſet not forth the deformity of the other? and yet in ſo pleaſing a manner, as may not cauſe in the weakeſt Judgments any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thoughts or ſtrange eluſions. But as it is certain, that they are the wicked that give ſcandals by raiſing falſe reports of others; ſo they are but the weak that apprehend them. I will not touch the particularities contained in this following Hiſtory, not to take from thee the pleaſure of the reading, deſiring it may ſatisfie thy expectation. And will reſt thine in all love to ſerve thee,</p>

And truly this world can no way be pleaſing but in variety, nor harmonious according to the imaginations of the Platonicians: As for example, we muſt yield that the darkneſs of the night makes us think the day more fair; and as ſad colours ſet off the light with greater
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98576:5"/>
luſtre, and as the blacks and ſullied colours contribute to the ſweetneſs and whiteneſs of the lilly, and as the thorns ſerve for an ornament to the roſes, as a calm appears never ſo pleaſing as after a fearfull tempeſt, as wines are never ſo ſweet as when the taſte hath ſomwhat of bitterneſs, or as hunger and thirſt makes one find thoſe meats delicious of leaſt ſavour; ſo peace is never in its true luſtre but after a long and hard war, even ſuch was before the return of this bright Star; war had even rent this Monarchy in peeces with diſſentions uncivilly civil, that it appeared our Nation was become a manicle, and took pleaſure in opening her own entrails and to unrip herſelf, more hungry then <hi>Saturn</hi> after the fleſh of his own children.

                     <l>With mangled trunks, and bodies of the dead.</l>
                  </q>
Then appeared this <hi>Henry,</hi> which returning from one end of the world, leaving a Country and Kingdom where he was adored, to give himſelf to this where his birth and inclination called him, was welcomed like another Saint <hi>Elme,</hi> or if you will, as a <hi>Neptune</hi> ferming the winds of ſeditions in their gale; and calming with the Trident of his valour, prudence, and goodneſs, the mutinous <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And then as the bitterneſs of gall makes us prove the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of honey, ſo contentment and peace unexpected raviſhed ſo the enjoyers, as it took away the means to expreſs their happineſs. You would have ſaid, it was a <hi>Solomon</hi> peaceably ſucceeding a bloody <hi>David;</hi> that greatneſs whereof <hi>France</hi> is the Mine, hiding in her own breaſt all her treaſures, which

now ſhe ſet forth to ſhew to the face of the earth: The Court ſhined like the heavens, ſtrewed with as many ſtars as there were Princes and Lords; the King appeared like a Sun, not only by his ſoveraignty which ſpread the beams of all his other greatneſs, but alſo the merits of his perſon; for in his counſels he was wiſeſt, at his exerciſes the readieſt, in arms the moſt valiant, amongſt the gallants of the beſt grace, in company the quickeſt-witted, amongſt the braves the moſt agreeable, amongſt the well-ſpoken the moſt eloquent, with the devout the moſt religious, among the rich and pompous the moſt magnificent; and whereſoever he was, he could never be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, nor take <hi>Alexander</hi> for <hi>Epheſtion;</hi> for he held his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with ſo grave a ſweetneſs, a face worthy of the Empire, as if appeared, ſhewed as if it had been written on his forehead and carriage, <hi>Behold the King.</hi> Yet all theſe truths are ſo far from flattery, that one ought to have had but eyes to ſee and ſwear that all came ſhort that could be ſaid of his heroick parts. True it is, I may with more boldneſs proceed to ſet forth his praiſes by the permiſſion of the wiſeſt of Kings: but in a time in the which one cannot imagine any pretenſion of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, being there remains none of his race; for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ſhould one expect of a Prince, that after the having poſſeſſed two great Scepters, hath lain many years upon the earth deprived of his laſt honour, his Sepulchre, remaining as the Poet ſung of his time his and his creature,

Living thus happy, adored of his ſubjects, beloved of his neighbours, feared of ſtrangers, eſteemed of all the world; when the heavens jealous to ſee ſo much proſperity on earth, ſowed emulation and jealouſies among the great ones, that have riſen to thoſe rayes which we can no way expreſs but with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, being it makes nothing to the Hiſtory that I have now to write, the which tragical misfortune happened during theſe great proſperities which I intend to paint forth.

But not to draw any harder this knot too delicate for my rude hand, I will only content my ſelf with this ſaying to come to my end, That the heart of this good King was very open to all worthineſs; many favourites he had. Let us repeat again this little word of liberty, as I ſaid, Favourites, and in great numbers; and as it is impoſſible in a multitude there will not multiply diverſity of humours and paſſions, according to the diverſity of judgments, and as they are intereſſed, It happened that a Lord of great birth and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that had place in the Kings houſe, fell not altogether in diſgrace, but in diſeſteem with the Prince, by the artificious induſtries of a Favourite that loved him not; and becauſe it doth concern me to conceal the names and qualities of the perſons in this hiſtory, by reaſon of the tragical events that ſhews in the line of this deduction, we will hide them with ſo much art, imitating the thunder that bruiſes the bones with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting the skin, melts ſwords and ſilver without hurting the ſeab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

We will do then as we behold the Bee, who draws the honey from flowers without any impreſſion, ſhe is content to drink of the roſe, and to draw the ſweetneſs and the eſſence, leaving it as if ſhe had never touched it; ſo we hope to conduct the nib of our pen with ſo much prudence and circumſpection, upon the flowers bitterly-ſweet of this field, now white with innocence, now red with murders; and without offending the families, or intereſsing the parties, we will diſcover the ray of this truth, learning from a great Hiſtorian, that it is very dangerous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many humane errors, and amongſt ſo many obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities that darken the courſe of this mortal life, to live only upon the ſupport of his proper innocence.

               <p>Thus our <hi>Timoleon</hi> was forced to yield under weight of his diſgrace; and as great courages are nouriſhed with favours of their Prince, could not endure to ſee they ſhould be grown cold in their affection; nor ſuffer the riſing of this new ſtar whoſe brightneſs ſeemed as the ſun to dim the ſmall morning-ſtars, to affront and darken this bright light which had ſhined ſo cleer, at leaſt with a jealous envy which did torment him pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. So that without ſtaying for a ſhameful leave, prevented his diſgrace, pretending to retire, deſired leave to ſell his place.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98576:7"/>
The King being good, although cold towards him, as having his thoughts occupied with opinions unworthy of his worth and true ſervices, and on the other ſide being a wiſe Prince, would not give him the diſcontent, put him off diſgracefully, was very glad that this demand came of himſelf; <hi>Timoleon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read in his face, that his abſence would be as pleaſing to him, as his preſence unpleaſing. But to enter the ſynagogue honorably, after having thanked him for his ſervices ſhewed to him and to his Anceſtors in his office, which appertained to the conſervation of their perſons, having been executed by him and his family to the Kings his predeceſſors with all loyalty that Soveraigns could deſire of faithfull ſubjects; his Majeſty, commended his reſolution, which was to retire from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs of the Court, to enjoy towards the end of his dayes in his houſe a quiet tranquillity, which could not be taſted in the affairs of the world. And becauſe the King deſired this office ſhould fall into the hands of a Lord, kinſman to the ſame we have deſcribed, and one who had followed him in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Poland,</hi> he made it known to <hi>Timoleon</hi> it would pleaſe him to have it conferred on him; and for a recompence, he ſhould receive ſuch as he ſhould hold himſelf very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, making a ſhew to be very ſorry that his ſon was not of years to execute it, who was brought up in Court with other Noblemens ſons; promiſing to acknowledge it when it ſhould be time, with ſome dignity or place that ſhould not be leſs in value. There was enough ſaid, and wiſely ſpoken for a Prince, that ought to hold it for a maxim inviolable, not to let any one leave him ill-ſatisfied. But it is ill done to jeſt with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; for the ears of Kings ought not to be imployed but with things that are pleaſant, and with ſweetneſs and humility. <hi>Timoleon</hi> having ill practiſed theſe rules, will have much le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

of violence to force him to render his place to one of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his enemy, being he had a deſign to leave the exerciſes of it to one of his own kinſmen, to have yielded to his ſon when he ſhould come to years to execute it. Upon which there ſlipt from him many ſtrange words, that the Kings pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too much urged changed into ſuch extreme choler,(anger of Kings the wiſe man compares to the fierceneſs of a Lyon, that makes all tremble that hear them) that he commanded him to void the Court within three dayes, and to take his ſon with him, giving him his own country for baniſhment, and his houſe for his priſon, with an expreſs command never to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf before his face. He would have anſwered, having ſuddenly repented; but the King retiring, left him there like a man ſtruck with a thunderbolt, before having ſeen the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Truly theſe indiſcretions are inſupportable; for as we ought not to write againſt thoſe we know can return it again, ſo we ought never to contend with thoſe that with a look are able to confound us. Behold <hi>Goliah,</hi> behold the Coloſſes of <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> broken with one blow of thunder, and a blow of one ſtone: here is a fortune overthrown for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and <hi>Timoleon</hi> reduced even to the terms of deſpair, imploys both young and old to obtain that at firſt ſo courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly was granted: but all his means and thoſe of his friends were in vain; for the King being full of rage and ill opinions againſt him, accuſing him of Rodomontadoes and inſolence, would ſhew him he was the Maſter; and thus imitating God, whereof he was the Image, he knew how to raiſe the humble, and caſt down the proud.</p>
               <p>His Enemy which loſt no time, believing that his expulſion from Court would give a greater freedom to his fortunes, and that the leſſening of this houſe would be a means to raiſe his own, obtained his office for his kinſman; which to ſatisfie the murmures and whiſpers, <hi>Timoleon</hi> was but too happy to receive a ſad recompence far off from that he might have had, if retiring in appearance with the favour of his Prince, and with hopes of better for his ſon. Here are dear bravings; this laſt makes all the ſweetneſs of the Court bitter: yet having been accuſtomed, he leaves it unwillingly and with grief; as ſlaves accuſtomed to ſervitude, their liberty ſeems weariſom; the air of the Country that is ſo ſweet to every one, to him is unpleaſing, becauſe he comes to be commanded by his exile;

This is the ſolitude of a ſad widowhood, the which he finds he is reduced to in age ſo advanced, that if he ſhould attempt a ſecond ſhipwrack, would be laid open to the laughter of all the world: And although that at this time he had need more then at any other of a wife to have care of his perſon, and to have comforted him in the government of his eſtate, a thing of Courtiers but very ill underſtood for the moſt part. And certainly it ſeems that which God in the beginning of the world ſaid of the firſt man, we may now ſay to the worldly man, That it is not good for him to be alone: for why? in the paradice of delights where <hi>Adam</hi> was created, he gave him a companion full of ſweetneſs and beauty, to the end that nothing ſhould be wanting that he could deſire in this happy eſtate of innocencie. Although the houſe of <hi>Timoleon</hi> were the faireſt of the world, yet coming from the moſt excellent converſations, with which the Court was as then both famous and in its luſtre; this ſudden change much aſtoniſhed him, principally when in this weariſom ſharp ſolitude his many buſineſſes which his long abſence had made very troubleſom, began now to be ſhut from all parts, having ſeen himſelf at Court much made of by his Maſter, cheriſhed by the greateſt, honored by his equals, obliging the meaneſt at his pleaſure, in a place of great eſteem; at a blow here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with the meaneſt of Nobility, which with the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to honour him come with hope to devour him. All this diſpleaſes him ſtrangely; all his comfort is in his ſon, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Gentleman, and of ſo good a faſhion, as that the moſt curious and ſumptuous King of the world had choſen him to be of his chamber. But as of one ſide this fair preſence gave him content, ſeeing himſelf to live again in this young branch; on the other ſide the heat of the wounds coming from the ſame
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98576:9"/>
place of his joy, in conſidering how by his own folly he had ruined the fortune of this child, having frozen him in his flower and root; this put him in an extreme melancholy, that cannot be expreſſed but by thoſe whoſe paſſions are only for the advancement of their poſterity. But what, is there no remedy? it is a bone of a horſe broken, which there is no means to ſet again. Now all his thoughts are to marry his ſon, yet thinks he is too young to put him to the yoke, and yet too old to be reprehended; he conſidered it would be very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have a fair and good daughter in law, which would be a great comfort to him in his age, eaſing him of thoſe houſhold-cares and buſineſſes, which to a noble courage are far more troubleſom then affairs of greater import; even as Flies are more troubleſome then beaſts of greater ſtature which are more hurtfull, by reaſon of their continual importunity. Many times he would ſay to himſelf that which the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious of Poets ſaid of the Father of <hi>Daphne,</hi> deſiring infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely that this maid ſhould leave the company and delights of <hi>Diana,</hi> and put herſelf under the laws of <hi>Hymen.</hi>

And many times our <hi>Timoleon</hi> would ſuddenly ſay to his ſon,

But this young Lord, which we will call <hi>Philippin,</hi> without much diſguiſing the name he received at his birth, very neer that of the famous Apoſtle which converted the Eunuch of the Queen of <hi>Candace,</hi> applying himſelf to games and paſtimes conformable to his humour and his years, gave little attention to theſe fatherly admonitions; for what can one ingrave upon a <hi>Mercury</hi> not fixt, or upon a running water which is never firm? Hunting is the principal exerciſe of this <hi>Adonis;</hi> for to what could this generous and noble ſpirit addict himſelf better, then to this occupation which is in peace the lively image of war. <hi>Timoleon</hi> goes ſometimes, but rarely, and ſometimes to thoſe which had more ſtrength; for the benefit, or if you will, the ill effect of years began now to make him unable for theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98576:9"/>
exerciſes; he loves his ſtable better then the following hounds, or the prey, then to hunt it: On the contrary, <hi>Philippin</hi> delighteth rather in the purſuit, then to ſee it in the diſh. The young Gentlemen thereabouts came often to this young Lord, he is much made of, honoured and reſpected of all; as it is the cuſtom of Courtiers to adore rather the ſun riſing then the going down. Whilſt the Father feaſts it with the aged, <hi>Philippin</hi> ſpits the woods in company of the youth: like that young <hi>Aſcanio</hi> neer the Prince of the Poets of the <hi>Romans,</hi> full of ſtrength and valour, he asks no more but even to encounter ſome huge Bore or furious Wolf, or ſome old Stag, to ſhew his ſtrength by the greatneſs of his prize. But after ſo many preys, he becomes a prey; after ſo many prizes he himſelf is taken, and all his ſtrength thrown to the ground, not by the teeth of a cruel Bore, nor by the horns of a Stag, nor by a ravenous Wolf, but by the glance of an eye worſe then that of Baſilisk; for this glance is his death, and which is worſe, a miſerable death.</p>
               <p>There was in a fair valley very neer to <hi>Bellerive,</hi> a little houſe belonging to a Gentleman that was Tenant to <hi>Timoleon,</hi> the ſituation of which ſhall be the occaſion to call it <hi>Vaupre,</hi> by reaſon it was invironed with delicate meadows and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant brooks, which made the ſeat very delightfull and pleaſing; you would have ſaid, having ſeen it, though little, but very well compoſed and truſſed together, that it ſhewed like a noſegay in the midſt of a garden of ſweet flowers. It was poſſest by a Maſter, in goods of fortune poor, but of a brave and reſolute courage, which will be well known in this our hiſtory under the name of <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> without altering his own but in one letter. This ſame had of children a ſon and a daughter, ſprung from a mother generous in all her actions, which we will name <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine.</hi> So that as Eagles do not ingender Doves, theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were nothing but courage and generoſity: The daughter which we muſt call <hi>Iſabella,</hi> brought into this condition by her brother, which ſhall be known under the name of <hi>Harman,</hi> leaving in her moſt tender yeares the occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ordinary to her ſexe, gave herſelf to exerciſes of arms and hunting with ſuch ſtrength and addreſs, that ſhe was much admired of all the neighbourhood, and eſteemed another <hi>Amazon.</hi> Her Father liking this humour in her, was well pleaſed to ſee her ride a horſe like man, to run at the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98576:10"/>

The mother was not diſpleaſed, as judging there was no point of honour loſt, of which ſhe was very jealous. So now as things ſtrange and new are moſt eſteemed, ſo theſe qualities extraordinary gave ſuch a fame to this maid, that all the vallies did reſound of nothing but her praiſes; and the eccho's gave an envy to the hearers, to ſee this wonder to all thoſe that heard of her.</p>
               <p>There was no aſſembly of hunting where ſhe was not yet always accompanied with either her father or brother: And as ſhe was alone in her faſhions, ſo ſhe ſhewed with ſo much the more advantage, and always accompanied with ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, as her preſence unaccuſtomed filled the hearts and eyes of the beholders with admiration and aſtoniſhment: For ſhe had been very well brought up, very ready in any thing ſhe undertook; ſhe ſpake with great diſcretion; her actions were compoſed, and at pleaſure detained, and although ſhe gave ſom what a lively natural liking to theſe exerciſes ſo far from her condition, yet nevertheleſs it was with ſo much ſimplicity and ſo little vanity, as if malice it ſelf ſhould have ſtrove to have bit, ſhe made herſelf not only irreprehenſible, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. And would to God that ſhe had either continued in theſe terms, or that ſhe had been retained within the bounds of thoſe exerciſes fitting her ſexe; we ſhould not then ſee her defamed as ſhe will be, nor the only inſtrument of theſe tragick buſineſſes, the which bloodies the courſe of this Hiſtory. The reputation of this <hi>Diana</hi> was not long before it came to the ears of <hi>Philippin;</hi> the which more for curioſity then for any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he had ever experimented, deſired to ſee her a horſ-back, and made this requeſt to her father, whom he ſaw often, who would not deny ſo ſmall a courteſie to his Landlords ſon, and the which ſhould one day be his chief jewel. There is a match made for hunting the Stag; <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Herman</hi> bring <hi>Iſabella</hi> to the ſport; who without any other deſign then that which all thoſe of her ſexe have, to ſeem pleaſing to the eyes of thoſe which did with curioſity conſider her, put herſelf in ſuch order, as her natural graces not being ſmall, were much heightened with art, that it was very eaſie for her to draw upon her the eyes of all that troop. I will not trouble my ſelf with the deſcription of her form, nor of the habit: For although the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

of her faſhion might much ſet forth and beautifie this diſcourſe, being dreſſed; yet nevertheleſs to ſhew the beauty of vertue and deformity of vice, rather then to preſent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral perfections, it ſhall ſuffice me to ſhew the cauſe by the effect, in ſaying that fire takes not hold ſo ſoon of the <hi>Nap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                     <l>His optick-nerves, when this ſtar ſhin'd,</l>
                     <l>Were Planet-ſmitten, and turn'd blind.</l>
                  </q>
This great blow ſtruck him in ſuch; ſort, as he remained pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and aſtoniſhed, all the time of the hunting; he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but rub over again his new wound, being more devoured in his thoughts then <hi>Actaeon</hi> was with his hounds: His heart was of ſoft wax for the impreſſion of this ſeal; and this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent form finding a ſoul as innocent as the whiteſt paper, drew a line ſo ſtrong that death it ſelf defaced the character. <hi>Iſabella</hi> imployed in the purſuit of the Stag, thought leaſt of this new prize, not eſteeming him coming newly from a Court as full of rare objects as there are ſtars in the skies ſhining in the night, would caſt his eyes ſo low as on her ruſticity, nor being ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous to raiſe hers ſo high as his with any deſign to make him her captive, to whom ſhe owed all ſort of obedience. So that the heart of <hi>Philippin,</hi> was a broken Looking-glaſs to receive the beams of this new light, and hers a Glaſs emboſſed which threw beams of deep impreſſion. Oh how happy had ſhe been ſtill to have done ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an eternal blame would not then have covered her memory.</p>
               <p>The iſſue of the hunting had ſuch ſucceſs as one would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and when <hi>Iſabella</hi> had given good teſtimony of her skill in riding, and of her underſtanding in this exerciſe, <hi>Philippin</hi> is returned to <hi>Beleriue,</hi> carrying to his father the head of a great Stag, the which had given them great pain in the taking; not without recounting the wonders of this <hi>Amazon</hi> with terms of that advantage, that it was eaſily judged he had conſidered her
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98576:11"/>
with very much attention; and yet he ſpake not the half of what he thought, and yet enough to make <hi>Timoleon</hi> deſire to ſee this Damoſel, that knew by skill to manage a horſe with as much skill as any Gentleman in theſe quarters. There is a new aſſembly made for hunting, where <hi>Timoleon</hi> ſees and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires her, wondring to ſee ſo much ſtrength and vigor in one of her ſexe, which uſually have weakneſs and debility for their part, &amp; conſidering that all which is extraordinary hath a kind of excellence. I ſay nothing of her beauty, becauſe I neither underſtand truly to conſider it, nor how to write of it; yet they ſay ſhe paſt all mediocrity, and being accompanied with ſo much grace and good faſhion, that the ſetting ſurpaſt the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtone, and the faſhion ſurpaſt the ſtuff. So that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin</hi> is not only touched, but tranſported; for to him all was admirable in her. This is not ſure that huntſman which lately had nothing in his head but woods and hounds; his imagination is ſo tranſported and fill'd with this new paſſion, that there is hardly left place in himſelf for himſelf; for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is quite baniſhed; this deity fills all his ſenſes; he is become ſad and melancholy; and he that heretofore could not underſtand other paſſion then an earneſt deſire to be riding and running, is now become grave and reſerved, much unbefitting his years; and loſing no occaſion of hunting where he thinks he may be ſo happy as to meet her, who hath thus taken him; on the contrary 'tis that which he ſeeks, and with ſo much curioſity, that he ſeems rather to flie then go; more lover then hunter in place of her, whoſe thoughts are more of her game then any way touched with love. Thus he ſees often <hi>Iſabel,</hi> but ſpeaks of nothing leſs then of his paſſion, covering it with the exceſs of his gravity, as there appears not ſo much as a ſpark in appearance.

The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual praiſes of this Virgin, that like lively flames came from the mouth of this young Lover from the furnace of his heart, were teſtimonies enough to <hi>Timoleon,</hi> whom years had taught the exceſs of this furious paſſion, and that the gentle faſhion and beauty of this Maid were fixed in the eyes of his ſon: For as Phyſitians will give ſtrong and great opinions of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of men by the ſight of their tongues, even ſo our own ſpeech will betray our interior thoughts to perſons of quick underſtanding; and who knows not that the birds, and other beaſts of the earth, by their continual cryes and ſtuttering make known to thoſe that underſtand them the heat which moves them when they are touched with the thing we call Love?</p>
               <p>At the firſt the good man diſdained to give a remedy, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was but a flame flying light, and might be extinguiſhed with the blaſt of his word. But his wiſdom found himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: for not having well practiſed this precept, That in ills of this kind we muſt at the beginning give remedies, Antidotes late and out of ſeaſon being improper to take away theſe inveterate impreſſions. The whilſt this little Butter-flie burns inconſiderately the wings of his deſire about this torch, which will be his end. Here is nothing but viſits to <hi>Vaupre,</hi> and matches for hunting; which he cares not much for, but as <hi>Dido</hi> loved it for to ſee her Aeneas, without his <hi>Diana</hi> it is to no purpoſe: <hi>Iſabella</hi> is the ſtar that lightens the darkeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities of the woods. When they are returned, he cannot ſpeak without proteſting, that as ſhe is the honour of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, ſo ſhe is the fortune of their prize; he ſhould ſay his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, as ſhe will be one day the diſhonour of his houſe. So that even as that cunning <hi>Anne,</hi> ſiſter to the Queen of <hi>Carthage,</hi> found that <hi>Dido</hi> was touched with the perfections of her new gueſt whom the tempeſts had forced to land in her ports, by the exceſſive praiſes which ſhe raiſed of his merits, eſteeming him a man deſcended of the race of gods: even ſo this young bird began to diſcover his note without ſhadowing his paſſion to the publike knowledge of men, and boaſts of it. He is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily at <hi>Vaupre,</hi> drawn by the inviſible chains of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and when he is at <hi>Belleriue,</hi> he is there in his thoughts: for why? the ſoul is more in the object beloved then in its own

body that keeps it. But becauſe he cannot accoſt this beauty without being acquainted with her mother <hi>Valentine,</hi> and her father and brother, he ſo ſubtiliſes his paſſion, which is the mother of inventions, to win theſe three's affections, which are very proud of theſe viſits; and when they perceived what he ſought, they eſteemed themſelves as much honoured, as the Match would be advantagious for them. Already <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> and <hi>Valentine</hi> feed themſelves with ſmoak of this great alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and <hi>Isabella,</hi> which was not made of braſs, ſeeing her ſelf ſo religiouſly ſerved and honoured by this young Lord, foreſaw things to her higheſt hopes, let herſelf be carried away with a reciprocal liking; in the which neither the one nor the other could have any blame; for almoſt their affections had one end by that great Sacrament which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in his Church.</p>
               <p>It is neither my humour nor my deſign to ſet down here what paſt in their woing: for beſides that I muſt either fain or divine; and although I ſhould know the truth, I eſteem it not fit with such ſmall entertainments to ſtay my pen any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, pretending rather to write of tragick actions then of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpeeches. Well, our <hi>Philippin</hi> is very welcome, well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived according to his merit, and the quality of his perſon obliged his vaſſals of which he deſired alliance; all were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as they ſay, without their Hoſt. For <hi>Timoleon</hi> perceiving clearly at length, that this affection took too great root in the heart of his ſon; having once ſhewed and admoniſhed him that he ſhould do better to keep company with his equals, and not to be continually with his inferiors; and that his too much frequenting of <hi>Vaupre</hi> going and coming, were not pleaſing to him. This was rather to augment his paſſion, then any way to diſſwade him from it: For in place of facility, the difficulty made him more deſirous and eager in this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. Even as the fire in the forge is made more violent rather then quenched by the often ſprinkling of water; ſo this Father of his being terrible ſevere, the leaſt word of his being like a flaſh of lightning which made his ſon tremble, he is become now more reſerved in his viſits. But as fire ſhut up in a furnace is much more hot then when it is free and in the air, ſo it is in the heart of this young <hi>Philippin.</hi> Letters, which make ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence preſent, are not ſpared: <hi>Iſabella</hi> having permiſsion of her friends to entertain this match, is no nigard of her anſwers.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98576:12"/>
And even as in thoſe Nations bordering upon <hi>France,</hi> where the women are kept in a continual priſon, and in ſo ſlaviſh a ſervitude as is impoſſible to be conceived, the leaſt action ſerves for a grant to thoſe that ſeek them; it was ſo here; for at theſe ſtollen viſits, by a thouſand arts which affection teaches, the proteſtations of fidelity were ſo ſtrong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Philippin</hi> made, vowing and proteſting that he could never be any others but <hi>Iſabella's:</hi> This maid aſſured for her part to this Lord, that ſhe would never receive other affection but his. Yet thoſe enterviews being kept cloſe from <hi>Timoleon,</hi> were nevertheleſs always in preſence of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or father, or at leaſt her brother, as thoſe ſtampers in the golden mines; ſo that her honour could not receive the leaſt blemiſh, no, not ſo much as a thought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timoleon,</hi> which had his watchfull ſpies upon the actions of his ſon, hath ſome notice of theſe ſecret meetings: which makes him raiſe his voice, and check his ſon more bitterly for his diſobedience, and with ſuch threats which much aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart of this young youth, yet no way removed his love; but on the contrary, like thoſe rubies of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which being put in vinegar redouble their luſtre, became more ſtubborn for theſe reproofs full of ſharp bitterneſs: And that which gave the moſt lively touch of his cruelty, was the forbidding of <hi>Herman</hi> the converſation of his ſon, which was brother to <hi>Iſabel;</hi> for in the abſence of the ſiſter, <hi>Philippin</hi> took ſuch delight in the preſence of her brother, that he could not be without him, and had as it were taken him to be about him. This was a kind of an affront to <hi>Herman,</hi> and which offended <hi>Pyrrhe;</hi> who, although the meaneſt Gentleman, yet had a courage ſuch as could not ſuffer of his Landlord, nor of a Prince the leaſt word or action which ſhould not only hurt, but touch his honour. So that being touched with a kind of revenge, after having made known his complaints to his neighbours of this uſage of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> he thought with himſelf to forbid <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin</hi> his houſe, which was to uſe as his equal his ſuperior. Here is <hi>Herman, Philippin,</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> in all the troubles of the world. <hi>Timoleon</hi> puts a man to his ſon, which ſhould have charge to look to all his actions, with an expreſs command never to leave him, or to be ſo much as a foot from him; leaving anything elſe to his pleaſure and free liberty, what he could deſire. On the other ſide, <hi>Iſabel</hi> is kept up very ſtrictly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98576:13"/>
by her mother, nor ever gets leave to ſtir out of the houſe, which is an impenetrable goale. <hi>Philippin</hi> gets no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: <hi>Timoleon</hi> laughs at <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> for having forbid him, being the greateſt favour he could have done him. There reſts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only their Pens, the which we give the name of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Birds, becauſe they flie and enter every where. By this means they make known their griefs; and this <hi>Danae</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the cruelty of <hi>Acriſe,</hi> which augments the deſire in him that ſeeks her to find the invention of <hi>Jupin.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, his active heat which like thunder pierces and enters all ſorts of obſtacles, in ſpight of all the watches of one ſide and the other, ſhewes them means to ſee and ſpeak together. The extream love and affection that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Herman</hi> and <hi>Philippin,</hi> the which had ſome reſemblance of that of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> brought forth this commodity. They meet at the hunting: And as <hi>Philippin</hi> made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to him whom already he eſteemed as his brother, of the extream cruelty of <hi>Timoleon</hi> and of <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> which in deſpight of their worſt nothing ſhould alter him from the deſign he had to marry his ſiſter; <hi>Herman,</hi> who much pittied this young Youth whom he ſaw in ſo ſenſible grief, gave him counſel to have patience, and to remit it to time, which might change and give ſome eaſe to his griefs; and excuſing his father who had forbid him his houſe, that it was not for any malice to him, whom he extremly loved and honoured for the worthy ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his alliance, but to let <hi>Timoleon</hi> know that he ought not to uſe a Gentleman in that faſhion, or to ſlight him ſo.</p>
               <p>All this did not heal <hi>Philippin,</hi> who could no way admit of this long abſence; and in the impatience of his diſpleaſure proteſted to dye a languiſhing death, if there were no means for him to ſhew to her which poſſeſſed him the aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his faith, either by verbal promiſes, or by writing, that might tye him ſo to her, as it ſhould be impoſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage them, in deſpight of the cruel uſage of their pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ts; and rather ſubmitting themſelves to all ſorts of misfortunes, then to fail in the leaſt point of their reſolution, even where paſſion ſhould go to the greateſt exceſs of cruelty againſt their youth. <hi>Herman,</hi> who paſsionately deſired this alliance for his proper a advancement, was eaſily perſwaded to find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity for this enterview, which was very eaſie for him to find, his ſiſter not being otherwiſe kept but within the cloſure of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98576:13"/>
the walls of <hi>Vaupre.</hi> He returns again to <hi>Philippin,</hi> and after having conferred with his ſiſter, told him he ſhould come in the night, and promiſed him to ſpeak with his ſiſter <hi>Iſabella</hi> at a window in her houſe, provided that it might be in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The which <hi>Philippin,</hi> who had no ill intent, yielded to very voluntarily. There is preparation for hunting the Bore: <hi>Herman</hi> is there in company of a Gentleman of the Country, a neighbour which was invited by <hi>Timoleon</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin.</hi> There are toils pitched in divers places where they think the horrible beaſt ſhould paſs; the word is given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Herman,</hi> and <hi>Philippin</hi> for to retire themselves; they are truſted through many woods; at laſt their hunting is ended, without ever once getting the prey into their tolls. At their return <hi>Philippin</hi> is not to be found; they hold him loſt in the woods; but this cunning old man doubting of the cauſe of his abſence, was very angry with this old Gentleman whom he had commanded not to let him go out of his ſight, commanding him to go &amp; watch all night at <hi>Vaupre,</hi> to ſee if he were not gone thither: for if he were loſt in the woods, it was an accident which often happens to Huntſmen; but if he were in the place he had forbidden him, he had prepared a rude reprehenſion.</p>
               <p>He was but too good a Diviner: For <hi>Scipion</hi> (ſo was this Gentleman called which had this charge of him) failed not to meet with the encounter: For coming to <hi>Vaupre</hi> just at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, where the neighing of a horſe gave him ſufficiently to underſtand there were Sentinels which watched without, he left his horſe tyed to a tree far enough from being ſeen, and came himſelf ſtealing ſoftly neer the place, and had the paſtime to hear the diſcourſe of this young couple, which cut their own throats with their own knives. But he was moſt troubled to hear the verbal contracts of marriage which paſt between them in the preſence of <hi>Herman,</hi> taking God and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to witneſs of their conſtant reſolutions; adding to that by the hands of her brother he received promiſes reciprocally in writing, to the end that the reproach of Infidelity might reſt upon the foreheads of thoſe that ſhould upon any occaſion be the breakers; proteſting ſolemnly, that neither the violence of their parents, nor any other humane power ſhould ever break this knot, but it ſhould be inviolably kept and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained juſt unto death: And after ſome rings given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98576:14"/>
in ſign of this alliance, they parted with much joy of that which they had promiſed and ſworn, and with grief to break off this ſweet company. A hundred times <hi>Scipion</hi> was juſt at the point to diſcover himſelf to have broken this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which infinitely diſpleaſed him; but for fear to put this young Gentleman into a deſpair, he durſt not; for if he had found himſelf diſcovered, his love would have kindled ſuch a choler in him, as he would have kill'd this Spy in the field, who rather choſe to ſerve himſelf with the Foxes skin then the Lyons, eſteeming that wiſdom would find eaſier wayes to remedy theſe follies then force; certainly follies, by the faſhion of their carriage, which were neither unlawfull nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable in their affections, all that was being in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of their conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timoleon</hi> is advertiſed of all this buſineſs by <hi>Scipion</hi> and falls into ſuch a fury, as he was very cholcrick; that there wanted not much, without ſaying any thing elſe to his ſon, to have ſhut him up in a priſon for a long time, intending to uſe him ſo ſeverely, as he would make him repent of his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inconſiderateneſs. Beſides, knowing that theſe ſecret prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes are not to be eſteemed by divine nor humane laws, ſo as he jeſted at this, promiſing to break them as chains of glaſs: but he means to teach this Gallant to play him no more of theſe tricks in this kind. He comes home the next morning to <hi>Bellerive,</hi> feigning to have been loſt in the woods, and to have been all night on horſe-back; and in that he ſpake but truth.</p>
               <p>But cunning <hi>Timoleon</hi> bridled his anger at his firſt ſight, to the end to make his correction more penetrating, being done in cold blood; and withall thinking by deferring his diſpleaſure, to get into his hands thoſe writings which had paſſed between them, which ſhould have been returned of <hi>Herman,</hi> the which <hi>Scipion</hi> had advertiſed him of. He cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts all his ſons Foot-men, to the end to diſcover this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in vain, for the buſineſs was already done: For at break of day, <hi>Herman</hi> coming out of <hi>Vaupre,</hi> and having brought to <hi>Philippin</hi> that of his ſiſter, and receiving of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin</hi> his, which he would have ſigned with his blood (an ordinary ferventneſs in young men in the like occaſions) if <hi>Herman</hi> had not hindred him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98576:14"/>In vain did <hi>Timoleon</hi> hope to ſurpriſe that which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received. But underſtanding by the treaſon of a Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quay, that <hi>Herman</hi> and <hi>Philippin</hi> did meet in many places, but with ſuch artificious ſubtilty, as the eyes of <hi>Scipon</hi> were ſtill deceived: At this <hi>Timoleon</hi> loſt all ſort of patience; and taking his ſon aſide, after having dimmed his eyes with flaſhes of his own full of anger, made him underſtand, and ſhould feel the thunder of his threats, if he left not the converſation of <hi>Herman,</hi> and the fooliſh love to his ſiſter, ſo far unfit for his quality. At which this young Courage was like to have fallen down at this ſo ſudden fright: For ſearching excuſes the beſt coloured he could, he found himſelf ſo taken, that the more he ſought to cover, the more he diſhonoured his paſſion; and the more he ſpake, the leſſ made himſelf underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timoleon</hi> judging by the often changing of his colour, and alteration of his diſcourſe ſo far from purpoſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his thoughts and the apprehenſion of his ſoul, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled this perplexity of relating the particularities of theſe meetings with <hi>Herman,</hi> he found certainly, he was betrayed. But more following this diſcourſe, by diſcovering of his ſpeech with <hi>Iſabella</hi> and <hi>Herman</hi> neer the walls of <hi>Vaupre,</hi> the night he feigned to be loſt, with the ſame words and promiſes, and thoſe alſo in writing which ſhould be put into the hands of his pretended brother-in-law; this frighted him in ſuch ſort, as thinking for certain it had been his Father which had heard this Comedie, he fell down at his feet, craving a thouſand pardons, beſeeching him to attribute this to the exceſs of his paſſion, which may well bring Youth to theſe ſtrange, courſes, being Age it ſelf when it is touched, is ſubject to commit many the like follies.</p>

                  <hi>Timoleon</hi> made tender by theſe ſubmiſſions, and believing he had applied the iron to the fire of this ulcer in ſuch manner as it was healed; promiſed him to forget what was paſſed, ſo that hereafter he would carry himſelf, with obedience to his commands and diſcretion in his actions, ſo that he might believe certainly that arrow was out of his flanks, and this vain affection quite removed from his heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98576:15"/>But as youth is like ſoft wax, that receives all forts of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and keeps not one; ſo <hi>Philippin</hi> promiſes what one would have him, being reſolv'd not to maintain any thing that the apprehenſion of fear makes him ſay, his love being far ſtronger then his fear. When retired from his fathers ſight, like a Criminal from the Tribunal of his Judge, it was then he blamed himſelf of weakneſs and want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and giving himſelf a thouſand injurious names, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing his fearfulneſs, and proteſting a new loyalty and ſervice to this Idol which ſwam in his fancy, he rubbed his ſore, and invenomed his wound by this conſtraint, diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all he had ſaid in prejudice of his promiſe; he renews his meetings and ſecret practiſes with <hi>Herman.</hi> But being ſold by his Lacquays in whom he truſted moſt, who for hanſel of their treachery put many of his letters and thoſe of <hi>Iſabels</hi> into the hands of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> by which he underſtood that reciprocal promiſes had been given on both ſides; which made him enter into ſuch an extream choler, as he had never had the like, ſometime threatning to ruine <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and all his houſe, and then to be revenged on his ſon for this diſobedience, as alſo to publiſh the ſhame of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Being tranſported to theſe extremities by his choler, he calls his ſon the ſecond time; and after having reviled him with all the outragious ſpeeches that could be imagined, eſteemed this relapſe worſe then his firſt fault.</p>
               <p>This young Lyon having taken courage for the ſhame of his laſt flight, like him which ſaid of himſelf, If I fled at the firſt encounter, it was to return the ſecond time to fight with more reſolution; ſetting aſide thoſe invective ſpeeches of his father, which his duty bound him to endure; after ſome holy proteſtations of the honour and reverence which he would always give him, he told him plainly, and in a faſhion of that height more then the ſpirit of <hi>Timoleon</hi> could endure, that he would loſe a thouſand lives rather then to fail in the leaſt point of his love; that his honour was engaged by word and by writing, and that his ſoul ſhould never receive other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion but that of <hi>Iſabella's;</hi> the which was a Gentlewoman, and of that birth, as ſhe could receive no reproach for her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, having no other wants but the goods of fortune; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to chuſe a wife which had vertues and perfections in abundance, then one with great wealth, which ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98576:15"/>
more unpleaſing then herſelf; and that this affection of his was led rather by reaſon then paſſion, honour and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage having been the end of his pretenſions; and if there Were any thing worthy reprehenſion; it was his carriage, not any thing in <hi>Iſabella</hi> or <hi>Herman;</hi> and for himſelf, he was reſolved never to leave their friendſhips for all the violence could be uſed on him, chuſing rather to ſuffer the extremity of cruelty, and the worſt of indignities, which ſhould be like flames to purifie his fidelity to the proof: And (as God lives) anſwered <hi>Timoleon,</hi> we will ſee whoſe head is beſt, yours or mine: How now, Gallant! what, ſcarce born, and are you at your defiance with me? I'll make thee as ſupple as glove, and to bend to my will, and break that ſtubborn will of yours, though it coſt me my life and goods, and yours too; I will teach you the duty of a ſon, and the authority of a father, ſaid he. And ſo turning from him, he commanded to put <hi>Philippin</hi> in a chamber which ſerved for a priſon, to the end to teach this young bird to ſing another tune. <hi>Philippin</hi> goes very joyfully contented, to give a teſtimony of his firmneſs and conſtancie of his flames. But that which put him in an extream agony, was to hear that his father having ſearched his chamber, and his ſecret Cabinet wherein were his ſweeteſt tyes, amongſt a thouſand Letters ſeiſed of the Promiſe of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> at which he made a trophie of mockery and laughter, and would have made a ſacrifice of it and of his choler to the fire. For now as being tranſported, what ſays he not againſt his father and his ill fortune, and againſt heaven? Truly thoſe things, which ought not to be repeated, but throughly blamed. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs comforting himſelf upon the word of his Miſtreſs, which he eſteemed beyond all the writings in the world, he reſolves upon the common remedy of all the ills of the world, Patience: Not but that the weariſomneſs of a priſon was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſenſible to this ſtirring ſpirit, active and full of heat; yet in this extream youth, which is nothing but fire and life, the tediouſneſs is redoubled by being deprived of news, which ſerved at leaſt in this his conſtraint of liberty to diminiſh his flame. Before he hoped all, and feared nothing; now fears all, and hath no hope But in the faith of the brother and ſiſter. He fears that thoſe Letters ſhould come to the hand of <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Valentine,</hi> they would not take occaſion to eaſe their childrens ill, His thoughts are ſo troubled, as when he reſts in this priſon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98576:16"/>
he thinks he is invironed with a thouſand thorns; he ſuſpects all which come near him, as he had reaſon, being made ſo many ſpies by <hi>Timoleon's</hi> means: He wants wherewith to corrupt them; this metal which changes courages, fails him; and his ſervants, whom his father had made his, dare not yield to pitty this young Lord. He thinks to entertain them with diſcourſe; yet ſeeing pitty dead in ſome, and affection in others, refuſed all, to entertain himſelf with his own private thoughts, the onely recreation that accompanied him; which in ſtead of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting him, nouriſhed his diſpleaſures. 'Tis Muſick which hath that property, to make them merry which are content, and thoſe which are ſad more melancholy: He plays reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able well on the Lute, and ſings well enough for a young Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who was more given to violent exerciſes then to theſe ſweet and peaceable. One day, for to expell the grief he felt, in theſe words expreſſing
<q>
                     <l>Hopeleſs and helpleſs in my ſad diſtreſs,</l>
                     <l>I ſink, my griefs admitting no redreſs.</l>
                  </q>
Thus the impriſoned <hi>Philippin</hi> comforted himſelf the beſt it was poſſible: But at laſt being not able to bear this weak and melancholy life, nor having any with whom he might freely converſe, his thoughts giving way to the vehemencie of his deſires, he was conſtrained to yield himſelf to the mercy of a ſickneſs, which brought him ſo low as within a foot of his grave; had it not been for his youth, good temper, and ſtrong diſpoſition, with the help of the Phyſitians and good means applied, he was even at the laſt point to loſe his life; and that moſt affected the ſad father, to ſee at point of death his onely ſon. Knowing the cauſe which brought him to this pittifull eſtate, he repented a thouſand times the cruelties he had uſed; an hundred times he promiſed him, but with words far from the thoughts of heart, to give him <hi>Iſabel</hi> to wife. At which name this poor dying man ſeem'd to enjoy new life; of ſuch, ſtrength is the empire of Love in the moſt violent pangs of death. His ſoul took ſtrength at this feeble hope to encourage his body, and by little and little the hopes of life came again, but yet ſo leiſurely he recovered, as rather languiſhing then living, they knew not what to do to reſtore him. <hi>Timoleon</hi> having many houſes, had him conveyed from one to another,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98576:16"/>
to try if the change of air would give him health: but it comes as heavy as lead, although his ſickneſs came poſt; certainly it is eaſie to deſcend, ſays the Poet, but very hard to get up. The farther he went from <hi>Bellerive,</hi> the worſe he was, becauſe he was further off <hi>Vaupre,</hi> where was the only remedy of his longings, and the only air that could recover him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot far from the <hi>Pyrene</hi> Mountains, amongſt many very pleaſant habitations, there is a little Hill, that for the beauty and fertility of it, the inhabitants call <hi>Gold-Mount.</hi> Here <hi>Timoleon</hi> hath a Caſtle, that hath two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which lightly are not found together, being both ſtrong and fair, invironed with a pleaſant country, and accommodated with all the delights one can deſire in a Country-houſe. He commands <hi>Philippin</hi> to be removed thither, and accompanies him himſelf. But by reaſon they ſeparated him from the Center of his affections, all theſe ſweet delights of this pleaſant Country were to him bitter and unpleaſing: they are conſtrained to bring him back again to <hi>Bellarive;</hi> where when as he began by little and little to get ſtrength, helped by the hope he had not to be any more croſſed in his love; <hi>Timoleon</hi> having made <hi>Scipion</hi> tell him, that now he thought no more of thoſe promiſes which he had made him, that he did it but to cozen his diſeaſe; he fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into ſuch a terrible frenſie, that whereas in his firſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they thought only of the loſs of his life, this ſecond they thought to take away his wits; for this troubled him ſo ſtrangely, and produced ſuch unformed actions and fearfull words, as none had ever heard tell of the like raving. Here is <hi>Timoleon</hi> more afflicted then ever; and the Phyſitians much troubled to find the cauſe of this new diſeaſe of body, not any

way conſidering the troubles of his mind, but only by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures drawn from the ſympathie of the two principal parts which compoſe our being, they imagine that having been bred at <hi>Paris</hi> and at Court, the air of the Country is not ſo natural as that of the Town for him, and that his ſadneſs cauſes theſe ſtrange humours in his ſpirit. <hi>Timoleon</hi> is perſwaded the ſame, and reſolves to bring him to a place where the frequenting of company might divert him from theſe melancholy fits. <hi>Bille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive</hi> is but a dayes journey from one of the principal Cities in <hi>France,</hi> where he may go without paſſing the bounds of his exile, which was not limited but within his own Province. There are more ſtore of Phyſitians and remedies at hand, and ſpiritual Comforters in greater number. His rank and quality noted in the Country, made him at firſt coming viſited by many of the chiefeſt perſons of remark. Time, which is the great Phyſitian of the affliction of the ſpirit, having drawn away the clouds which ſuffocated the reaſon of <hi>Philippin,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him now more fit for conſolation then he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this houſe in Town ſeeming more like the life and air of the Court his firſt element, gives him ſome eaſe of his many ſufferings. Here of a ſudden he is returned to his ſenſes and perfect health; yet nevertheleſs always his heart returns towards <hi>Vaupre,</hi> as loving that ſide of the North. Many viſits he hath every day, as much for the reſpect of his father, as for the ſweetneſs of his own converſation. Though not quite healed of his wound, nothing is ſo pleaſing to him as to ſteal by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſometimes, to contemplate his thoughts in the object he could not ſee but with the eyes of his underſtanding. As many men as attend him, are as ſo many Watches; ſo that he might ſay as the holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>So many domeſticks, as many enemies.</hi>

                  <hi>Timoleon,</hi> which ſaw this fire was covered with aſhes, not quite out; preſſed in part with deſire to divert his ſon from this affection prejudicial to the greatneſs of his houſe, and partly with deſire to ſee him married, which of neceſſity muſt be done; ſometimes conſulting if he ſhould ſend him into <hi>Italy,</hi> or to travel into <hi>Spain,</hi> or to imploy him in the Town in thoſe exerciſes which young Noblemen ordinarily uſe. His friends counſelled him not to ſend him into thoſe ſtrange Countries ſo ſuddenly after his ſickneſs; it is his only ſon, the light of his eyes, the ſtaff of his age; this changing of Country
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98576:18"/>
will not change his affection, as marriage would. All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that marriage was a tye that would ſettle him in peace, and bring him comfort, and aſſure his houſe, withdrawing him from all theſe youthfull paſsions. <hi>Timoleon</hi> makes choiſe of this, forced to it by his domeſtick neceſſities; for his ſo long having been a Courtier, living at a great height of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, had brought him much behind-hand and in great debts, having been conſtrained to mortgage a good part of his eſtate. A good portion would clear all this. This deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made known, there would not need much time to find a fit Match for him, as being of ſo noble a houſe; the best in that Town would be very proud of his alliance, to match their daughter ſo honorably. A Magiſtrate of a ſoveraign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, wonderfull rich, having but two Daughters, the eldeſt being married to one of the Officers of this Eſtate, the ſecond we will call <hi>Eliſe</hi> for two reaſons; for truly ſhe bore the name of the famous Couſin viſited by the Mother of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when ſhe was with child of the Forerunner of <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and becauſe methinks ſhe hath ſomthing in her innocencie found fit to be compared to the Queen of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whom the Prince of the Roman Poets, that pleaſing lyre, hath taxed with having committed a fault with <hi>Aeneas,</hi> of which ſhe is reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by thoſe which have written the true hiſtory of her chaſte carriage.</p>
               <p>This younger was a Maid, although but indifferently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the gifts of nature in what concerns the face, in ſo much as ſhe was judged better for a Wife then for a Miſtreſs; but on the other ſide ſhe was ſo endowed with vertue, and with that which moſt eſteem, riches, that this abundance of gold was able to make any one to think deformity it ſelf fair. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleon</hi> ſees this Maid for his Son, and like him which more conſidered her wealth then her form, finds that this great portion would quite clear all his affairs, and diſengage all his houſe. He ſpeaks with <hi>Scevole</hi> (thus we will name this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, father of this Gentlewoman) who is not ſlow in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes on this great alliance, and promiſes to ſet all his reſt, and to make <hi>Eliſe</hi> his abſolute heir univerſal, ſo it may be accompliſhed. To ask &amp; obtain, is all one thing. She is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elder then the Youth; but that is no matter, that's the leaſt, <hi>Timoleon</hi> cares not for that; he ſhall have crowns in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and which is more, an Officer which will maintain and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98576:18"/>
govern all the buſineſſes of his houſe. He concludes it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely with <hi>Scevole,</hi> who doubts nothing of the obedience of his daughter, though <hi>Timoleon</hi> cannot aſſure himſelf of his ſons. Yet reſolved to imploy his force where love could get no place, one day having called him, makes a ſpeech to him with all the ſweetneſs he could borrow of his pride and greatneſs of his ſpirit: He ſhewed him the debts and neceſſities of his houſe, of which the fall and ruine was at hand, if it were not reſtored by ſome rich Match, and therefore counſelled him to think ſeriouſly on it, forgetting his unworthy thoughts of that <hi>Iſabel</hi> which had almoſt loſt him his life and wits too, and to beſtow his love upon ſome Lady of the City, without thinking longer of this Country-wench. Doth not he play the father of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſeeking to turn his ſon from the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Dalilah?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſon finding himſelf uſed with all ſort of ſweetneſs, having heretofore found nothing but rough carriage, found himſelf touched in the tendreſt of his affections. But as it is impoſſible that a new Veſſel ſhould loſe the ſmell and colour of the liquor with which it hath been firſt fill'd; he was in great pain how to anſwer his father according to his deſire: And yet not willing to ſet him abroad to no purpoſe, he eſteemed it better to direct his ſpeech with that government, as might not ſeem altogether to oppoſe him. He began to conſider the neceſſities of his houſe, yet not eſteeming them other but that his father might repair them with good husbandry. But when he was urged by his father to ſeek a Match in the Town, after having excuſed himſelf of his tenderneſs of years unapt for that; <hi>Timoleon</hi> having taken him at that word, told him he ought not then to do it with <hi>Iſabel.</hi> Sir, I believe it, replied he, that marriages are made in heaven, and practiſed on earth; and it is hard to reſiſt the influence of this cauſe, being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded above to that point. And therefore he beſought him to pardon him, having received of God free-will, and not of him: Although the reſpect he ought him might hinder him from marrying, yet his authority ſhould not be ſo tyrannous as to make him take a wife againſt his will: For hot being poſsible to have both, he could never be others then hers, whom the heavens and his conſent had firſt given him. Scarce had <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleon</hi> patience to hear his laſt word with a dying liberty, when putting himſelf into his accuſtomed threats and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98576:19"/>
yet withholding himſelf in the midſt of this torrent as impetuous as impious, for fear to put this young Lord into thoſe extremities which his violent cruelty had heretofore reduced him to. So conſtraining his nature, he caſt himſelf on rebellion and diſobedience, and ingratitude of children; ſaying they were accompanied with the pride of liberty, that without any wiſdom or experience they will make laws to their fathers, and by their ſottiſh love and particular fancies bring deſolation to their houſe. With this his choler made him utter many frivolous threats; as, That if he did not marry, he would diſinherit him, and give him his curſe if he ſhould ever marry with his Vaſſal, reproaching him of baſeneſs and poorneſs of ſpirit; withall ſpeaking many invective words againſt this Gentlewoman, by reaſon of her skill in ſo many exerciſes, the rock and wheel being fitter for her. To all which <hi>Philippin</hi> anſwered with ſilence; excuſing himſelf, that having given his word and promiſe in writing given and received, he could not before God nor men take other wife but <hi>Iſabel,</hi> without deceiving her. Hereupon <hi>Timoleon</hi> conſulted with <hi>Scevole;</hi> yet hiding moſt part of his diſpleaſure, and theſe denials of <hi>Philippin:</hi> This fooliſh Boy (ſays he) being abroad one day, falls in love with a Tenants daughter of mine, a Gentleman here by, and ſo far as he hath promiſed marriage; Can this promiſe bind him? To which <hi>Scevole</hi> anſwered, no; but that all theſe private contracts, ſecret practiſes and flying oaths, promiſes by word or by writing, were as air or running water. <hi>Timoleon</hi> joyed as if <hi>Scevole</hi> had given him life, goes and conſults with the Theologians, which teach him the ſame doctrine, the laſt Councel of Oecumenie declaring null all marriages clandeſtine.</p>
               <p>He returns to his ſon, of whom he promiſed himſelf an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured victory: For having demanded of him if he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to his obedience, if he did ſhew him that all his oaths and ſignings were worth nothing; now this youth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming them in full ſtrength, yielded to give him all honour and reſpect: He brings a company of Lawyers and Divines to decide this difficulty before him; but he eſteeming it a trick, would not believe them. He gives him liberty to go to any of the Town, to enquire himſelf; where having found conformity in all, he was much aſtoniſhed, finding himſelf taken by the noſe, to the prejudice of his <hi>affection.</hi> He muſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98576:19"/>
doubt no more. Whilſt he ſtrives to hinder theſe baits, and to kick againſt the pricks, the more he fills his way, and puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into blame and ill opinion of all, and encourages his father to uſe his authority, who hath no watch but on his goods. He is reprehended of rebellion and diſobedience: here is heaven and earth againſt him, ſtoned with the reaſons of all thoſe which have no feeling or ſenſe of his love. One day ſeeing himſelf vanquiſhed by his fathers propoſitions, which like a cunning Fencer preſſed him ſtill further; after having put the ſhame in his face, and turned all the fault on him; Sir, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, they which will ask a reaſon for Love, may as well ſeek freſh water in the ſea, or birds in the floods, and fiſhes in the air: For the reaſon of Love is Love it felf, whoſe empire is ſo ſtrong, as it maintains it ſelf good againſt our ſelves, forcing us to do that we would not, and making us do that we ought not. 'Tis true, theſe promiſes by words or writing are nothing in right, but yet in deed, for the one and the other are in being: That which I received of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> is in your power; but that which I writ and ſealed, is in her hands. I know not how to reſolve my ſelf of this ſhamefull denial, as long as theſe are in being firm; for they will ſerve for an eternal reproach of my infidelity, which will be to my perpetual ſhame.</p>
               <p>Is this the cauſe, quoth <hi>Timoleon,</hi> that withholds you from ſhewing your duty in obeying my commands? Why, whether <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> will or no, it ſhall be very eaſie for me to break and make it of no effect. He ſuddenly diſpatches <hi>Scipion</hi> to <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre</hi> with the Promiſe of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> to deliver into into the hands of her father, and to demand that of his ſon; who was much aſtoniſhed to hear this news by the mouth of <hi>Scipion,</hi> with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of credit from <hi>Timoleon:</hi> For as all this buſineſs was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed without his knowledge, he was much diſpleaſed that his daughter durſt proceed ſo far without his conſent, fearing ſome further buſineſs: but underſtanding of <hi>Scipion</hi> that had been an eye-witneſs of that nights meeting, that all their diſcourſe was performed according to laws of honour, and in preſence of <hi>Harman,</hi> who had received the promiſes in writing on the one part and the other; he had reaſon to ſay the ſame which the deſpiteful <hi>Juno</hi> ſaid againſt the Goddeſs of <hi>Cypres,</hi> in the greateſt of Poets:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98576:20"/>

                     <l>Thou haſt acquir'd victory, whoſe fame</l>

                     <l>Fair <hi>Venus</hi> and thy Son, whoſe powers all do</l>
                     <l>Invoke with honour, and with reverence too:</l>
                     <l>If powerfull Gods with ſubtilties do ſubdue</l>
                     <l>A woman in thoſe arts ſhe never knew.</l>
                  </q>
For how was it poſſible that poor <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould not yield at the perſwaſions of a brother, propoſing the greatneſs of a Marriage, on which (ſaid he) depends the happineſs of our houſe; beſides, being preſſed by his ardent affection to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin,</hi> which in his perſon wanted not perfections to deſerve the love and ſervice of all. Now <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> although poor in the goods of fortune, was nevertheleſs ſo rich in honour, that he would not by any unlawfull means have come to a better. Having then promiſed <hi>Scipion</hi> to give <hi>Timoleon</hi> all content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to employ his uttermoſt power for to return the Promiſe of <hi>Philippin;</hi> he called aſide his ſon and daughter in the preſence of their mother, and chid them ſharply for their proceedings; telling them how he had diſcovered from point to point (as he had heard from <hi>Scipion</hi> though not naming him) their nights-meeting, their diſcourſe, and promiſes given in writing.</p>
               <p>You never ſaw any ſo aſtoniſhed as <hi>Harman</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> were; who threw herſelf at her fathers feet, asking pardon, excuſing herſelf by the permiſſion ſhe had to entertain this ſeeking of <hi>Philippin.</hi> But <hi>Harman</hi> more couragious, taking all the fault on him, beſought his father to excuſe the innocencie of his ſiſter, for whom he thought to procure a fortune very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, nothing having paſt in all their affections which might any way alter the reputation of their family. But where is this Promiſe of <hi>Philippin's?</hi> quoth <hi>Pyrrhe.</hi> The which <hi>Iſabel,</hi> who carried it ordinarily in her boſom, gave freely into her fathers hands to diſpoſe of as he thought fit. They conſuited with themſelves, if they ſhould deliver it to the hands of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> taking that which he brought, or if <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> ſhould go himſelf and deliver it to <hi>Timoleon?</hi> but found inconveniences in both theſe propoſitions; yet the moſt aſſured was that they reſolved: For in the firſt there was bounty and generoſity, and in the ſecond more certainty of reconciliation between

the Lord and his Vaſſal, betwixt whom there was no ſmall hatred; and yet to truſt <hi>Scipion</hi> in a buſineſs of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, under a simple writing, was not fit. That <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> ſhould go ſpeak himſelf with <hi>Timoleon,</hi> there was ſome danger to be feared, being both of a ſtout courage, and of a Nation whoſe heads are very hot; falling to words, might produce ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous effect. <hi>Harman</hi> is appointed to go with <hi>Scipion,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this promiſe to <hi>Philippin,</hi> and to bring back that of <hi>Iſabel.</hi> But the brother and ſiſter retired into ſecret counſel, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other proceedings; for <hi>Harman</hi> reſolved to carry the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Philippin</hi> to ſummon him to the effecting of it, which was not according to the intention of his father. See but into what a labyrinth diſobedient youth thruſts it ſelf. He returns with <hi>Scipion</hi> to the City, leaving his ſiſter to the mercy of a mother which torments and uſes her cruelly: For <hi>Valentine</hi> finding this action odious and diſhonorable, had almoſt with her extreme chiding brought her to deſpair.</p>
               <p>But let us leave her between the anvil and the hammer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe aſſaults fatherly and motherly, refining the temper of her patience; to underſtand the good operations of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> who being arrived, inſtead of exchanging Promiſes, cites <hi>Philippin</hi> before the Juſtice, to acknowledge his Deed and Seal. <hi>Philippin</hi> received this aſſault ſtrangely; for he would have been very glad not to have denied his hand, yet this form of proceeding a little altered him. As for <hi>Timoleon,</hi> he was ſo enraged, that if he had met with <hi>Harman,</hi> he had torn him in as many peeces as a furious Lion would a Goat. <hi>Scipion</hi> ſaid, this was not the command of <hi>Pyrrhe;</hi> but that he ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Promiſe of the ſon, and receive that of his daughter. <hi>Harman</hi> ſtood obſtinately not to give it up, deſiring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his ſiſter againſt the will of his father. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure betwixt <hi>Philippin</hi> and <hi>Harman</hi> came by reaſon of the ſtrict watch <hi>Timoleon</hi> kept of his ſon, ſo neer, as he took away all means of communication, or writing. This ſignification was made by <hi>Harman</hi> ſo ſuddenly, as it was done without any conſultation of Lawyer or other councel; for having laid the buſineſs on the Table before the grave and wiſe Judges, they told him it was a ſimple part of him to undertake a buſineſs of that conteſtation. <hi>Scevole</hi> is advertiſed of it, who aſſures <hi>Timoleon</hi> to break all this like a glaſs. Yet <hi>Harman</hi> having ſpoken with <hi>Philippin,</hi> purſues his cauſe by the advice he had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98576:21"/>
of him; having received aſſurance, if it came to judgment, he would not detract either from his word or writing. In the mean time <hi>Timoleon</hi> diſpatches another Letter to <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> in which he tells him, That the Gentleman he had ſent the other times had brought other teſtimonies of his worth then his ſon made now ſhew of; and that if he were a man of his word, he ſhould make <hi>Harman</hi> forbear theſe proceedings, the ſucceſs whereof would but turn to his confuſion; deſiring him to come himſelf, or to ſend a teſtimony of his expreſs will and pleaſure, that by that he might judge of his intentions; and that he would ſtill have him for his friend, if he would deal in that ſort, that his daughter might not pretend any alliance with his ſon.</p>
               <p>At this news <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> fell into extreme choler againſt <hi>Harman;</hi> and getting on horſ-back, comes preſently to Town: where no ſooner arrived, but <hi>Harman</hi> retires for fear of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> deſires to ſee the writings of the Proceſs, and takes forth <hi>Philippin's</hi> Promiſe, and with the ſame ſpeed carries it to <hi>Timoleon,</hi> and in the delivery gives braving words and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domontado's uſuall with thoſe of that Country. The ſubtile old man puts him off with fair words, without any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but only that <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> had juſt reaſon to be angry with his ſon <hi>Harman,</hi> which had paſſed the command he gave him; and had reaſon like an honourable Gentleman to diſprove the proceeding of his daughter, who would have ſeduced <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin.</hi> At which word (ſeduce) <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> enters into a new fury, which made him ſpeak wonders. But <hi>Timoleon</hi> was ſo glad to have gotten into his hands the Paper which ſo angred him, that he thought (as they ſay) to have the Wolf by the ears: ſo that giving way to the paſſion of <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> to gather ſcum at his pleaſure, he was content only to anſwer him thus coldly, That he was content to have him for his Vaſſal, but not for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and that he knew the means how to humble him at his pleaſure as time ſhould ſerve; that for the preſent he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to return him the Promiſe of his daughter, counſelling him if he eſteemed the honour of his houſe, to deal with her in that ſort, as that ſhe ſhould not be ſo liberal of her promiſes and writings, otherwiſe he would hardly find her a husband. Theſe words ſpoken with ſomwhat a ſatyrical tone, bit out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly cruel our <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> never anſwering but with taunts and bravado's, making himſelf laught at by thoſe which heard
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98576:21"/>
him; for although a Gentleman, he was nevertheleſs ſo infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to <hi>Timoleon,</hi> as they were not to meaſure their ſwords to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>The Promiſes rendred, there was no more cauſe of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> gave a diſavow of what his daughter had done, and <hi>Timoleon</hi> the ſame for his ſon; friends of both ſides ſeek to make peace with the vaſſal and his Lord. <hi>Timoleon</hi> for his part ſeems not unwilling: <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> who knows of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it is to him to be reconciled, lets himſelf be eaſily drawn: words of precipitation are given in choler, they part friends. Here are all the ſtrings of <hi>Philippin's</hi> bow broken; what ſhall he do? he is like the bird tyed by the leg, the more it flutters, the more it is pinched, and more it ſtrives, the more ſtrangled. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> arrives, and keeps ſuch a life againſt his ſon and daughter, ſuch as one may judge of a proud man having loſt his pretenſions, and being returned with having engaged a piece of his honour. Whereas <hi>Timoleon</hi> triumphs on his ſide, and tells of his intention to match his ſon with <hi>Eliſe;</hi> ſhe was both vertuous and rich, which are two qualities which both the world and reaſon eſteem more then beauty. He knew not how to withſtand his father by contradiction; his youth told him this was another <hi>Lea</hi> that they would put upon him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of his fair <hi>Rachel;</hi> for truly this Maid had not ſo much of beauty as to be eſteemed fair, and yet enough to warrant her from the title of being ilfavoured, although ſhe was ſo in the opinion of <hi>Philippin,</hi> not being fair; his thoughts are continually occupied in the idea of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> whoſe only name ſpake beauty it ſelf, and was able to make the brighteſt ſtar appear to him deformed. What ſhall he do? for this grief is incident to all: He feigns to be touched in conſcience with many ſcruples; not contented with the reſtitutions of their Promiſes, he will have an act of Juſtice for his juſtification. <hi>Timoleon</hi> demands it of <hi>Scevole,</hi> who obtains it incontinently by his credit, and by reaſon and juſtice. This is not enough, he ſays; it was their parents which have made reſtitution of the Contracts, but he held not himſelf diſengaged, if firſt he ſaw not a writing of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> by which ſhe acquitted him of his promiſe by words; eſteeming that a man or worth is as much bound to preſerve his word as his writ; the writing being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a visible teſtimony of faith given. Said this young Lord to himſelf, <hi>Iſabel</hi> will never ſign to ſuch a diſavow, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98576:22"/>
if ſhe ſhould, he might have juſt occaſion to complain of her, and to accuſe her of inconſtancie and aptneſs to change: <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleon,</hi> who ſaw that this was the laſt rampire of his ſons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, having promiſed his father to think of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> if this Diſavow were but obtained; anew ſollicites <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> deſiring him to oblige him ſo much as to procure him a declaration from his daughter, importing the return of his ſons word given her, although it were no way neceſſary but to ſatisfie the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the conſcience of <hi>Philippin;</hi> promiſing to acknowledg this courteſie by thoſe good offices, which ſhould bind him to believe their reconciliation was not fained. <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> which ſaw himſelf ſought to by his Lord, and in a thing wherein he believed to return that which he thought he had engaged his reputation in at their laſt meeting; promiſed to <hi>Scipion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently, who was imployed in this buſineſs, to give him that which <hi>Timoleon</hi> demanded. But he counted without his Hoſt, foraſmuch as he found more reſiſtance in <hi>Iſabella</hi> in this, then he had ever done before: For judging well by this (as ſhe was wiſe) that <hi>Philippin</hi> ſought all poſſible means to defer the marriage with <hi>Eliſe,</hi> of which ſhe had already had news, being now common in City and Country, ſhe plainly ſhewed her unwillingneſs, ſaying that was unneceſſary, and that ſhe would not give a writing which might prove prejudicial to her honour. But in the end <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Valentine</hi> her mother threatned her ſo much, that having drawn from her many Letters which gave teſtimony enough of her conſtrained wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that effect, at laſt contented themſelves with this, where ſhe ſeemed to open herſelf with more freedom and liberty, addreſſing herſelf to <hi>Timoleon</hi> thus:</p>

My Lord, both he and I are ſo much theirs who have brought us into the world, that it ſeems not only our lives, but alſo our fortunes, our, wills and words depend abſolutely on their authority. Methought it had been enough to have rendred the promiſes in writing, without preſſing me any further to renounce by letter his

This is not to complain, but rather to give a teſtimony of joy that I receive in the news of the marriage which I underſtand you, intend to imbark him in: I wiſh to God it may prove as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to him as I deſire it. If I were free, and that my preſence might not bring any hindrance to your joy, I would be one in that aſſembly, to raiſe by the ſhadow of my defects the brightneſs of this chain of gold you'll put about his neck. I believe the feaſt will be great, and will not paſs without thoſe exerciſes, of which I promiſe my ſelf I ſhould give a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my skill and courage, which would raiſe me far beyond thoſe of my condition. But becauſe this cannot be without troubling your content and his conſcience, I will give you a teſtimony of it by the freedom of this diſavow; That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am not rich enough to be your daughter-in-law, I have yet courage to diſdain the quality, in leaving the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to another, and ſuffer without grief what my ſelf hath loſt. Do not miſunderſtand me, that I accuſe you of rigor or cruelty, or my father of conſtraint, being you both do me a great favour in breaking my bands and ſetting me in my firſt liberty; it is a grace for which I ought rather to thank you, then to complain as of injuſtice. All that angers me, (you will be pleaſed I may uſe the prtviledge of my ſex, my Lord, to ſpeak freely to you) is a true report which hath been delivered me of ſome certain diſgracefull words have ſlipt from your judgment, prejudicial to my reputation: My Lord, you know my exerciſes, and that I carry ſomthing elſe by my ſide then a Spindle to be revenged, and to prove lyars all thoſe who would offend that which is dearer to me then life. I deſire no other teſtimony then your ſons againſt you; of whom I did not entertain the love, but by permiſſion of my friends; as I now renounce, to ſhew my obedience. It may be ſome detractor hath deceived you, making you believe otherwiſe of me then you ought; wherein, when you pleaſe, you may confeſs your error. I muſt give thanks to her whom you have made choice of for your daughter, to enter into your alliance, having made me retire; for I would not have a father-in-law that ſhould eſteem me other then what I am: If ſhe be more noble in riches, I may highly ſay I am richer in nobility; and if ſhe be above me in rank, I am

I wiſh you more happineſs and content in this alliance, then you have hoped for of mine; returning you by the commandment of my parents all thoſe Promiſes that I might have pretended of my Lord your ſon, from whom I expect the ſame return, and in the ſame form as hath fallen from my pen.

I can complain of nothing but my ill fortune, which permits me not to enjoy that I deſire, but carries me to that I flie, with a deſtiny inevitable. 'Tis in vain to withſtand a torrent; 'tis prudence to yield to a misfortune which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withſtand; 'tis wiſdom to render our arms when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vanquiſh. She which returns my word in calling her own, teaches me by wiſe obedience what emperie Reaſon ſhould have of Paſſion, and what an aſcendant power Duty hath of a ſupple ſpirit. Having never ſeen but perfections in all her carriages, I will from henceforth believe that Change is a vertue, ſince ſhe puts it in practice. Her action being then my rule, her example ſhall ſerve for my reaſon. Heaven wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with me, it is to pleaſe her that I return that ſhe will have, and which I cannot keep againſt her will. Knowing well how much I ever honoured her, I could not better make ſhew how I eſteem her vertues, but in imitating them; that if I be accuſed of inconſtancie, ſhall I not have reaſon to call this accuſation unjuſt, that diſproves in others that which they authoriſe in themſelves? I confeſs to you, Sir, that I have uſed all poſſible means to preſerve inviolable my bonds: but ſince they have broken my chains, I cannot hinder them to tie me in another place, ſince my fortune and birth have made me fit for ſervitude. It is not that I ſhould not have honoured your alliance, and that I ſhall not try by all ſort of ſervices to give your houſe proofs of my love: But ſince I muſt follow the courſe that firſt enchained me, I let my ſelf be carried by a ſtream of water which promiſeth me nothing but a ſea of bitterneſs. I go then to put my will under thoſe commands of my father; God grant that my obedience make this ſacrifice more happy then my augure tells me, and bleſs you with as many proſperities as you deſire.</p>

                  <hi>Timoleon</hi> found many things in this Letter contrary to his humour; nevertheleſs was glad to draw what he could from this ill pair; and did not deſire altogether to diſpleaſe this young man, in conſtraining him to write another more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his own fancie, being that in effect he had what he deſired, with the return of the word of <hi>Iſabel;</hi> who had no ſooner had communication of this writing that <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> let her ſee, but left almoſt to live with having ended the Letter. To tell you the raving and aſſault that this wrought in her ſpirit, cannot be expreſſed but by ſilence: Yet nevertheleſs being wiſe and diſcreet, at firſt, and before her father ſhe ſtrongly diſſembled the grief which pinched her very heart, ſhewing ſo conſtant in apparence, that you would have ſaid this action of <hi>Philippin's</hi> was in different to her. But when ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into her private Cabinet, and this retreat, without teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, gave her liberty to recall her paſſion; ſaying thoſe words, and uſing thoſe actions, which ſhe ought neither to have done nor ſaid, if ſhe had had but any reaſon left; there wanted not much that her ſoul had not ſtollen from her in her abundance of tears, and that the ſobs and ſighs had not ſtopped her breath. I will not with a lazie pen fill the pages of this book with reciting the inutility of her complaints; we muſt leave them to the divining of thoſe ſouls outraged by feeling the like diſgrace. How many different projects rolled in her thoughts? Sometime ſhe would, in a ſute of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, go find out this perfidious Lord, to grapple with him like a Fury revengetrix, and to cover him with reproaches of his weakneſs and inconſtancie. But as ſhe was of a great ſpirit, the conſideration of her honour held her within the bounds of modeſty, knowing well that ſuch a habit would wrap her in an everlaſting infamy. But then ſhall ſhe dye an obſcure death, not only deprived of enjoying her legitimate pretenſions, but alſo of revenge? I aſſure you, that between theſe two extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities her underſtanding was thrown into ſtrange convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In this outrage ſhe became invironed with ſo ſtrong a melancholy, that ſhe would neither ſee any, nor be ſeen of any; if ſhe could have ſeparated herſelf from herſelf, ſhe would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have done it. So ſhe fell into a profound ſlumber, forced by a thouſand griefs, nor thinking of ought but of diſpleaſures which continually pelled her patience.

Not that ſhe was unworthy to be conſidered, not being ſo unpleaſing but ſhe might deſerve the love of any: but truly, how ſhe could be loved with the love of friendſhip, I will not ſay; but very hardly by that of love, by a heart already enjoyed, as was this of our young Courtiers. He nevertheleſs ſees her, more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with her vertue, then amorous of her perſon; and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains her like a man whoſe affection is rather in his looks then in his heart: It is a ſimple thing to make love by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in the end he enters like a fiſh into a net, even as forced, not having any will that the beginning ſhould tie a knot of neceſſity which could not be broken but with the ſharpneſs of death, and with all the repentings in the world could not be diſſolved during life; for it is not in humane power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn thoſe which the divine hath joyned.</p>

               <p>She had brought up theſe two Daughters, which were all the children ſhe had, with much modeſty and great fear of God; and as <hi>Eliſe</hi> had been longer under her diſcipline then
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98576:26"/>
her ſiſter <hi>Elinor,</hi> ſo ſhe ſurpaſſed her in humility and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. She was of more years then <hi>Philippin,</hi> but very few, being very diſcreet and judicious, that nothing was wanting in her to make her an accompliſhed mother of a family: Her vertue, ſweetneſs, modeſty, and the extreme affection ſhe had to her husband, was ſo great, that in the end he was conſtrained by ſo many obligations of ſtrong chains to love. You would have ſaid that ſhe brought into the houſe of <hi>Timoleon</hi> the ſame qualities that <hi>Raguel</hi> ordained in his daughter <hi>Sara</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Tobias.</hi> She was quiet and pleaſing to her husband, reſpectfull and ſerviceable to her Father-in-law, who became almoſt her idolater, he was ſo much raviſhed with the good offices ſhe rendred him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philippin,</hi> who is not altogether inſenſible, is conſtrained to yield to ſo much goodneſs; for there is no heart ſo hard, ſays an Antient, which will not give love not being conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the only price of love is love; the charm without witchcraft to make one beloved, is to love: And what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is there not to love her, which loved but him; who loved not day but to ſee him, nor breathed but to pleaſe him? He muſt be a rock that ſhould not yield himſelf to ſo juſt, ſo holy and legitimate a flame. For although his thoughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and his imagination filled with the conſideration of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other idea, not leaving any void to imprint this new impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet his reaſon vanquiſhed by ſo much love, is conſtrained to acknowledge it by a mutual return of love. You would ſay that as <hi>Iſaac</hi> tempred the grief he had for the death of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the coming of his wife; ſo our new Bridegroom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting altogether his firſt furies, to range himſelf within the bounds of duty and obedience, wrapping up theſe flying fires in the ſacred and ſolid: marriage is a wiſe march, which we ought to conduct with much temperance and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That husband which expects ſo much ſeeking from his wife, is, as an Antient ſays, no other but an adulterer; thoſe who mingle ſo much niceneſs and curioſity in this venerable alliance, ſtrengthening their valour and eſteeming their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This Sacrament ought rather to be practiſed by ripe and ſtaid judgments, then by heat and deſire. Happy had <hi>Philippin</hi> been, had theſe conſiderations been weighed in the other ſcale of his carriage: but his years too tender did not as yet make him capable of theſe ſolid governments; but only neceſſity, the

fear of his father, and the ſtrong aſcendant power the vertues of his new wife had gained in his judgment, held him within the bounds of duty, with much admiration of all thoſe which ſaw it, who would never have thought ſo happy a beginning in marriage to have had ſo unfortunate an end, as this which I have almoſt with Honor writ.

She comes in company of her mother <hi>Valentine,</hi> to ſee <hi>Eliſe</hi> and her mother <hi>Sophie,</hi> which came to help her in her houſhold-government. This viſit filled all the neighbourhood with joy and content, ſeeing this quarrel alogether extinguiſhed. There <hi>Eliſe</hi> ſees <hi>Iſabel</hi> with the eyes of a Dove full of meekneſs, like Simplicity it ſelf; uſing her with thoſe courteſies ſo extremely obliging, that ſhewed plainly the goodneſs of her heart. But the other more malitious, beheld her as one which did robbed her of her treaſure, diſſembling nevertheleſs with much art the

O how contrary were the thoughts of theſe two Rivals! the one full of vertue, admired and loved the graces which God had endued her with; the other with a jealous envy conſulted often with her glaſs, to ſee what advantage her complexion had of that of her ſupplanter.</p>

All this is but artificial within, although without he makes no ſhew of any thing but ſimplicity. But even as the fire of thunder, the more it is incloſed in the clouds, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the lightning it ſhoots forth; ſo the more there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the more dangerouſly he lanched his looks on this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazon,</hi> heretofore ſo paſſionately deſired; yet nevertheleſs he felt great contention in himſelf betwixt reaſon and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: For when Reaſon was miſtreſs, favoured by the abſence of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> and the ſight of ſo many vertues which ſhined in all the parts of his <hi>Eliſe,</hi> he tryed with a ſponge to forget and deface the form of this Face, the idea of which tormented him.

Poor <hi>Philippin,</hi> thou ſpeakeſt well, now that thy reaſons are ſtrengthened by the ſervices of thy <hi>Eliſe,</hi> which kept thee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of thy deſires: but when the law of ſenſe rebels againſt that of thy underſtanding, ſowing revolts, ſeditions and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in the city of thy exterior, 'tis then that loſing courage, thou returneſt into thy firſt frenſies: yet fight thy ſelf, and thou mayſt become a reaſonable vanquiſher, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh thy paſſion.</p>
               <p>The whilſt theſe active viſits paſſed under colour of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, being made more frequent then <hi>Timoleon</hi> could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; the hunting ſerved often for a pretext, but another cauſe is the ſubject. The cunning old man intends to get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this misfortune, and not to fall from a fever to a hotter ill, cut off all new beginnings of loves. Although his ſon be not much advanced in years, yet marriage having given him more liberty, it would be unfit to exerciſe upon him the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and rigorous cruelty which he uſed to him being a youth. Remedy there is none better then that Phyſitians pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the cure of cathars and rheums, diverting them when they cannot dry them. We have ſaid that <hi>Monte-gold</hi> is a very fair Caſtle, and of ſtrength and importance, which was within three days journy of <hi>Bellerive,</hi> at the foot of the Pyrene moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Under pretext to ſhew it to his daughter-in-law, he brings all his train, and, that of his ſons. 'Twas <hi>Philippin</hi> who was diſoriented, but more <hi>Iſabella;</hi> who at this laſt ſight had ſo increaſed her flames, whether it were by temptation or otherwiſe, that thus being deprived, it had almoſt caſt her into her grave: ſhe judged this remove was cauſed againſt her; ſhe knew no remedy but to flie to patience. <hi>Philippin</hi> was ſomwhat aſtoniſhed at firſt for this abſence, and remains ſad

and penſive ſome time. But this light fire which began to burn about his heart, kindled by the ſight of this object, this abſence made his relenting leſs: For as one wins by the loſing of others, ſo there is no doubt but abſence revives, as preſence kills. The holy and ſincere love of <hi>Eliſe</hi> won him ſo ſtrongly, that his reaſon was quite renewed; for if Vertue, as an Antient ſaith, would raviſh altogether the heart, if it were but viſible, why ſhould it not raviſh his, ſhewing ſo viſibly in the perſon of the chaſte <hi>Eliſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh if he had made in this time a happy proviſion of wiſdom, or if he had taſted ſeriouſly and ſolidly this butter and honey of diſcretion, which makes one diſtinguiſh good from evil, he might well have known the extreme difference which is between a vertuous affection juſt and holy, and a bruitiſh paſſion unlawfull and diſhoneſt: For in ſtead of the precious balm of this, as the ſweet ſmell of a flowry field pleaſing both heaven and earth, God and men, giving to thoſe which, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured as they ought a taſte of the pleaſures of Paradiſe; the infamous exhalation of the other defames the proper au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ſcandalizes their neighbours, and makes them feel in its tyrannie a forerunning of the unquietneſs and torments of hell. If <hi>Philippin</hi> could but have conceived to have received in effect this thought, we ſhould not be in pain to find words pittifull enough to expreſs the calamities which drive him in conſequences of depravings inſupportable. But not to make him unfortunate before his time, give us leiſure to conſider him in this good hap, too great for him, if he could but have known or comprehended it. For as if void, or at leaſt exempt of the moſt lively points of his firſt love which tormented him, he thought of nothing more then pleaſing his father, and full of deſire to render himſelf reciprocal to the tender affections of his new Bride <hi>Eliſe;</hi> paſſing in this faſhion the moſt quiet and tranquile life as may fall into humane thoughts, in eaſe, wealth, paſtime, and abundance, without ſolitude; all honour and invite him, rejoice and are pleaſed with his fortune. Truly he enjoyed a happineſs not common, and which cannot be eaſily conceived but by thoſe which know the difference of a vicious frivolous love, and a conſtant and vertuous; for the glory of ſuch delights cannot be comprehended by all ſorts of underſtandings. The ſun never ſhines on the earth, but it brings to theſe chaſte Lovers ſome ray of new favour; Night

ſhewed not ſo many torches in the deepeſt of the heavens, as they kindled fires in their ſouls; their contentments not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated with their holy and legitimate uſage, finding as in heaven deſire in ſociety, becauſe that modeſty held their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affections under the bridle of reaſon in ſuch a faſhion, that being poſſeſſors of their deſires, they ſeemed yet to deſire the poſſeſſion, by a ſtrange agreeing in hope of enjoying. It pleaſes me to paint thus fair and pure, though ſoft and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, theſe marriage-affections; becauſe methinks one cannot ſet too high a price of that which is legitimate; For why? all that is good, all that is holy and chaſte, all that favours well and which hath renown of worthy, ought it not to be raiſed by a Pen, which hath no other end in that he writes but to honour vertue, and deteſt vice? Muſt we always repreſent <hi>Antigonus</hi> with that ſide his eye was worſt? ſhall we never ſhew draughts with our pencil, that we may ſhew that ſide which is moſt pleaſing? Malicious pens will do wonders to ſet forth falſhoods with that art, that it is uneaſie to read them without being filled with ill ſuggeſtions; and ſhall it not be permitted them which fight for chaſtity, to ſhew the legitimate incloſures in this ſacred bond, or according to the Apoſtle, that their bed is without ſtain, which is the true ſign of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity? But alas, how fair weather keeps leaſt conſtantly his clearneſs; and how few days cleer, but are troubled with ſome clouds! Whilſt <hi>Philippin</hi> makes heaven jealous of the felicities he enjoys on earth, this fair day hath his night; and as his ſubjection was his happineſs, his liberty was his ruine.</p>

Now the thoughts of his Idea <hi>Iſabel</hi> was ſo weak in his ſoul, that he thought not of her but as a thing indifferent; he ſees but by the eyes of his <hi>Eliſe,</hi> nor diſcerns nothing but by her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo poſſeſſed by the object of ſo much vertue, that vice could have no place in his ſoul. This Golden Mountain was a hill of perfections; and for the temporal bleſſings and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual that God ſhewed largely upon this houſe, one might have called it a Mountain of God; a mountain very fertile, a Mountain in which it pleaſed God to inhabit; God filled it with his bleſſings in favour of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> as he did heretofore the houſe of <hi>Laban</hi> in conſideration of <hi>Jacob.</hi>

                  <hi>Timoleon</hi> ſeeing his hopes and deſires ſurmounted by his proſperities; ſayes ſometimes as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> chaſed from <hi>Athens,</hi> That he had been loſt if he had not been loſt; and his following of the Court would have ruined his houſe, if his baniſhment from thence had not called him to its reſtoring. He ſees himſelf new-born in the beginning of a poſterity; for during this time <hi>Eliſe</hi> was brought to bed of a daughter, which <hi>Timoleon</hi> named by the name of his wife deceaſed, which was that of the famous Penitent, which we will expreſs by that of <hi>Dalimene.</hi> He deſires a ſon; there is great likelihood heaven will grant him this grace; for <hi>Eliſe</hi> had ſome feeling of a

ſecond birth, when all of a ſudden a great outrage came and troubled theſe felicities, and to cover with thorns ſo many roſes. It was the unexpected and ſudden death of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> who going a hunting, fell from his horſe coming down a ſteep place; and having much bruiſed his head, a hurt very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to old men, he yet had ſome time to think of the health of his ſoul, and ſo yielded his breath to God; not having had leiſure to exhort his ſon, not to diſpoſe of any thing whatſoever. They carry home the body (for he dyed in the fields) in a blanket to <hi>Gold-mount.</hi> Which poor <hi>Eliſe</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had been the Stag which they had hunted, ran full of joy to meet her Father-in-law deceaſed: which when ſhe ſaw, it touched her ſo lively, the paſſions of joy and melancholy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in her heart, that fell into a ſwound; and being in the eſtate ſhe was, brought her almoſt to keep company with her deceaſed father. But too happy, if this misfortune had but fallen on her; for then this bloody tragedy would have ended, which we intend to write; for after this, ill fortune never ceaſed to perſecute her innocence, even to make her guilty of death, without having committed any crime at all. Injurious fortune, when wilt thou ceaſe thus to perſecute ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? ill encountred Cranker, muſt thou have ſtill the faireſt Roſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellerive</hi> is the burial-place of the anceſtors of <hi>Timoleon;</hi> the pleaſure of <hi>Gold-mount</hi> is turned into ſadneſs by the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his death: This body muſt be conducted to the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of his fathers. O <hi>Philippin,</hi> whither goeſt thou? muſt thou, to ſhew thy love and duty to the dead, give death to thy Love? or rather to light with thoſe Funeral-torches the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brand of this <hi>Iſabel,</hi> which will reduce thee and thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour into duſt? Oh if the lips of <hi>Timoleon</hi> could but ſpeak, they would counſel thee from this journy: Oh if death would permit him to make an oration to thee, with what efficacie of words would he have diſſwaded the meeting the firſt object of thy flames. Poor Butter-flie, thou goeſt to burn the wings of thy deſires in a torch which will undo thee. Love is that devil of the Evangel, which once returned into a houſe from whence it hath been baniſhed, remains more ſtrong then before, making thoſe whom it poſſeſſes more furious then ever. We muſt not ſet thoſe which are full of rage, in the preſence of the beaſts which bit them, they will but redouble their torment; we
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98576:30"/>
muſt not approach a ſmoaking torch with fire, if we will not have it lighted. The greateſt ſecret the Apoſtle knows to prevent fornication, is to flie; thoſe which love peril, will periſh. <hi>Eliſe,</hi> why doſt not thou by thy wiſdom find ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to prevent this diſaſter which thou goeſt to gather in this funeral-voyage? But when a misfortune will follow one, ſays a grave Antient, it ſeems his wiſdom is ſhadowed, and his judgment blinded, not being able to prevent his headlong ruine.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Bellerive,</hi> all the Gentlemen thereabouts, but eſpecially thoſe which held of <hi>Timoleon</hi> as his vaſſals, came to render their laſt obedience to the ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The fair Amazon, now as free as a man, by the death of <hi>Valentine</hi> which was gone to God during this reſidence at <hi>Gold-mount,</hi> being become unſeparable company to her brother <hi>Harman</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> her father, came with them to the funerals of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> which was her honour, and the happineſs of <hi>Philippin;</hi> for the appear'd clothed in a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing habit, ſo advantagious to her natural graces, that one would have ſaid, what ſhe had done ſimply to honour the funeral pomp, and wearing the mourning for her mother, made with ſuch art, ſeem'd exceedingly to grace her.

                  <hi>Iſabel</hi> lanched forth looks more ſhining then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of thunder, lightning, ſent from a dark black cloud: And for a pittifull encounter, <hi>Eliſe,</hi> which had no beauty but in her vertues, ſhewed with an extreme diſadvantage to her natural diſpoſition under theſe mourning habits; withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much affected for the loſs of her father-in-law, whom ſhe honoured infinitely, and loved with an incomparable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nothing defaces ſo much the beauty of the face, as a true and ſincere grief: For to appear fair and pleaſing, ſhe muſt have been content too, and happy. So that juſt as the bargain is half made with the ſecond merchant, when we are diſpleaſed with the firſt; the deſires of <hi>Philippin</hi> revolted againſt reaſon by this enterview; of which the one rubbed with the wings of ſadneſs, hath loſt her ordinary effect to draw the iron of his heart; the other armed with a thouſand drawing ſpirits, raiſed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98576:31"/>
and tranſported him in a moment from his true being: Their looks, meſſengers of their intentions, made their hearts ſpeak, which were reduced to aſhes by theſe ſparkles framed by this unhappy collection. The furious Lion roaring and watching without ceaſe to devour us; that Dragon that ſeduces us by theſe artificious idea's, filling our thoughts with malicious il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions; that Spirit ſworn againſt our ſalvation, which loſes no time to indammage us, covering the eyes of <hi>Philippin</hi> with double deceit, made this illegitimate object appear far more pleaſing then ſhe was; and on the other ſide made her which he ſhould and ought juſtly to have loved, appear hideous to him, that he conceived a ſecret horror againſt her, not being able to comprehend with himſelf how he had continued ſo long. And truly her grief, and the eſtate ſhe was in, which we hold will make the moſt fair ſeem unpleaſant, with this habit ſo little favorable to the mediocrity of the form of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> contributed to this diſlike of <hi>Philippin.</hi> The other ſtrangely inſolent by the knowledge of her preheminences, like a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, with her tail covering and crowning herſelf with pride, throws ſhame upon other birds; glorying in her victory, and loaden with trophies of her new conqueſt, retires home triumphing, leaving <hi>Philipin</hi> in the moſt ſtrange unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can be imagined. When we throw a ſtone into a ſtill water, it multiplies the circles infinitely: This ſight forms a thouſand impreſſions in the ſoul of this young man, till now ſo peaceable and quiet. O <hi>Philippin,</hi> 'tis here thou ſhouldſt reſiſt this evil which fights againſt thee; 'tis here thou oughtſt to take antidotes againſt this poiſon, which ſlides through thy veins, and will trouble the reſt of thy bones and the health of thy fleſh. If thou diſſembleſt, thy intrails will become rotten and old; and the ſpiritual gangrene giving death, grace is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>available. But unfortunate, thou flattereſt thy misfortunes, and angreſt thy ulcers with ſcratching.

He will do nothing: his ſickneſs pleaſes him better then his health, he prefers a tempeſt before a calm, and death before life, the priſon before liberty. This Syren hath ſung him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in ſo deep a lethargie, as it quite transformed him; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98576:31"/>
a captived will, yet voluntarily he yields to this ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and holds it his greateſt happineſs. He foreſaw many ills which threatned this change, but he ſhuts the eyes of his judgment not to take knowledge of them.

                  </gap>iercely that he hath not. Here is this young Lord reſpected like a new ſtar riſing in the horiſon of this Country: his Vaſſals come to give him homage, whilſt he meditates how to make himſelf Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Vaſſal. He appears free, and yet is more a ſlave then when he was under the juriſdiction of his father; A horſe broke looſe without either bit or bridle, a ſhip without a ſtern, a cloud full of black water; of blind paſſion blown by the wind of covetous ills. Already he receives the innocent embraces of <hi>Eliſe</hi> againſt his heart; and as ſick men that loath the meats which they have been greedy of during their healths, ſo that which was here to fore his contentment, is now become inſuppportable. His eyes armed with ſcorn, never looked on her but to diſdain her; her preſence is odious, her prudence ſuſpect, her care and good huſwifery avaritiouſneſs, her mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty a beaſtly defect. And as all we ſee through a coloured glaſs appears of the ſame colour as the middeſt that deceives our ſight; even ſo not conſidering her vertues, but on the contrary judging by this ſecret change, which will ſhortly change into a formal hatred, ſhe appears odious to him like vice it ſelfs.

Already this Leah, although fruitfull, is nothing to the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of poſſeſſing a fair <hi>Rachel;</hi> all the hony that he had heretofore gathered in the company of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> changed into bitter forgetfulneſs. <hi>Eliſe</hi> eaſily perceives this coldneſs; but as ſhe was good and ſimply diſcreet, ſhe threw the cauſe upon the death of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> which ſhe thought affected <hi>Philippin,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98576:32"/>
although her grief were far greater then his for that loſs, whoſe boiling heat of paſſion in love was far from thought of ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the death of his father. The more ſhe thinks to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, the more he is diſpleaſed; the more ſhe courts him, the more he ſeems to be importuned; and although ſhe ſtrives as much as may be to cover with a falſe joy a true ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet could he not hinder but his face, his actions and words betrayed him, making it appear to thoſe which had leaſt of apprehenſion, that there was I know not what in his thoughts which tormented him. <hi>Eliſe</hi> ſees this, and is in an agony incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable: She thought it was a wrong to her husband to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem he had any ill opinion of her; ſhe is too innocent to find in herſelf any ſubject of diſcontentment that ſhe had ever given him, and there is nothing ſhe thinks leſs on then the true cauſe of this alteration. Jealouſie of <hi>Iſabel</hi> ſhe had none; for ſhe believes that time hath healed <hi>Philippin</hi> of this old impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But in the end the many matches made for hunting, made her plainly ſee they were not without deſign; and the other viſits to <hi>Vaupre</hi> made her to know the fire by the ſmoak, the beaſt by the foot: but ſo late, that the evil was almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Philippin</hi> was in extreme agonies; for the way of the perverſe is ſowed with a thouſand thorns: All ſeemed contrary to his deſires. The cunning <hi>Iſabel</hi> which ſaw ſhe had returned him into her net, and that ſhe held him in her goal by means as full of ſubtilty, as <hi>Eliſe</hi> was full of ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, who made as if ſhe ſaw not that which ſhe did but too well perceive. <hi>Iſabel</hi> ſeems not to take notice of that which doth clearly appear; and by her flying and fained retiredneſs adds deſire in <hi>Philippin</hi> to ſee her. Induſtrious <hi>Galatee,</hi> that draweſt in flying, and hideſt in ſhewing thy ſelf! For coming to <hi>Bellerive</hi> to viſit <hi>Eliſe,</hi> and then he ſeeing her at <hi>Vaupre,</hi> it was always in the preſence of his wife, or of her father or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he ſpake to her, which was an extreme torment to this paſsionate. This damoſel full of vanity, took pride tormenting him, without giving him any hope to quench the leaſt ſpark of this great fire in his breaſt. Judge but the craft of this creature: Here is a <hi>Tantalus</hi> dead with drougth in midſt of waters; and like the Page of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he is conſtrained in ſilence to burn. It ſerves him not to ſpeak with Eyes, language
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98576:32"/>
which ſhe hath heretofore well underſtood; now fains not to underſtand, by a deafneſs as great and greater then that by which ſhe is beloved. The good of <hi>Philippin</hi> is his hurt: For this liberty to ſee that which he deſired, redoubled his paſſion, and makes him periſh with a death and languiſhing grief by the object which is the cauſe. All his ſtudy is to make known to this malitious creature the renewing of his antient flames; but that in ſuch a faſhion, that neither <hi>Eliſe, Pyrrhe,</hi> nor <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> underſtood any thing; yet all ſee clearly like Eagles. The jealouſie of a wife is not to be feared: The valour of <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Harman</hi> are not unknown to him; although his Vaſſals, they are noble, and Gentlemen full of honour, and that rather then abate the leaſt point, would loſe a thouſand lives.</p>
               <p>Oh how true it is, that evil men travel by ways ſtubled and full of ſtops and difficulties, and attain much wearineſs in the end of their iniquities. If once his courtings be but perceived by ſo many eyes as watch him, all is loſt, there will be nothing but tempeſts within, and ſhipwrack without. If he but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the end of his unjuſt pretenſion, it is but an aſſured loſs of his reputation, and may be of his life: For if <hi>Eliſe</hi> perceive it once, farewell friendſhip and peace; but that is the leaſt he thinks of: If either her father or brother ſhould ſuſpect any thing, there's no more frequenting nor viſits, no more duty nor acknowledgment; A quarrel that would ſet all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen upon him thereabouts, and make him odious to <hi>Scevole</hi> and to all that knew the rare vertues of his wife. And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, there is no hope. He is too far in the buſineſs; his paſſion holds his foot at his throat; he is fallen and loſt, he is altogether undone. To diſſemble his ill he cannot any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he cannot without death; and to dye without daring to complain or make known who is the cauſe, he cannot reſolve. Here is our <hi>Ixion</hi> on the wheel. It is moſt true that a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit is his own hangman; he gets much by ruling his actions and motions. He loſes his countenance at the aſpect of the Baſiliſco, whoſe ſight kills him. This moving he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder, betrays. He ſpeaks to her enough, but not enough; as much as becomes him, but not enough; for 'tis not that he would, or cannot, or dares not manifeſt to her. She ſee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> him nevertheleſs, and ſeems ignorant. (Learn the cunning of women by this ſame.) So that our paſſionate <hi>Philippin</hi> dies
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98576:33"/>
of a ſickneſs obſcure and hidden, in midſt of all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and remedies that opportunity ſeems to preſent him. In the end the impoſthume grows; That which he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for with his tongue, he borrows with his pen, being an interpreter of his thoughts which cannot bluſh. That makes known to the artificious Amazon what ſhe knew already; but as ſhe loved her honour, and was jealous of her reputation, ſhe ſtruck againſt the rock of a chaſte reſolution theſe firſt points, making all theſe conſiderations recoil before the impenitrable buckler of a holy cruelty. The glory of having captived ſo great a courage, left not to flatter her; ſeconded with pride of a ſecret joy, that ſhe had in her hands the means to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of <hi>Philippin</hi> for the wrong ſhe thought he had done her, in leaving her for one of meaner beauty. And as there needs to infernal <hi>Archimedes</hi> but one point out of the earth, for to raiſe all the earth; it was by this large gate of vengeance that he convey'd into the ſoul of this maiden the Trojan horſe, the funeral-torch that put all her reputation in aſhes. What doſt thou, <hi>Iſabel?</hi> in ſtead of ſending back his Pacquets, thou receiveſt and concealeſt them, without giving any notice to thy father or brother. Ha! this is not the courſe of a wiſe Maiden, which like the Mother of Pearl ought not to open but to receive the dew of heaven; nor to receive other court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings but thoſe of a legitimate marriage, with the permiſſion of her parents. You will hide ſerpents in your breaſt, and then complain you are ſtung very ill; you let in the thieves, and then complain of being robbed; you put in fire, and then are aſtoniſhed if it burn you. Where is your wiſdom, <hi>Iſabella?</hi> I well perceive you are of that unfortunate band, that are not wiſe but in doing ill; whilſt you are parlied with, you intend to yield, you betray your ſelf in capitulating with a Traitor, as if you were agreed with him to your own ruine. You help him to make to your parents inviſible, that which he will not have viſible but to you. Poor Rahab, thou hideſt the Spies that will be cauſe of thy deſtruction and infamy. O daughters that have underſtanding, learn by the fault of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable one, ſince ill examples ingender good manners; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe theſe little Letters, which are as ſo many chains to bring your hearts into ſervitude; and hunt theſe foxes which break down thoſe incloſures that make you honoured and eſteemed. The abuſer <hi>Iſabel</hi> becomes abuſed, and diſadviſedly ſeduced;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98576:33"/>
A juſt puniſhment of her craft and cunning. She lends her ears; and conſents to the writings and diſcourſe of this deceiver <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin,</hi> and helps herſelf by her folly to weave the cord which draws her to ſhame. She hears this charmer, which flatters ſo well, as he awakes in her that which diſdain had made but ſleepy, not killed; covered, not quite put out. He colours his courting with a mask of honour, to make her by this golden outſide better to ſwallow the pill of diſhonour: Proteſts he eſteems her his legitimate wife; ſays he will declare that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Eliſe</hi> null, as having but too many proofs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> as to her that of <hi>Pyrrhe;</hi> that the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contrary to their firſt promiſes were forced from their pens, not from their hearts, and that violence was notorious. To theſe rays of apparent reaſon <hi>Iſabel</hi> lights her firſt heats, putting (as in the time of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>) fire in the oven:
<q>
                     <l>Thoſe Philter-charms of Love did re-inſpire</l>
                     <l>Her breaſt inflamed with a vigorous fire.</l>
                  </q>
Greatneſs flatters her courage, which is high; Honour, which ſhe conceives by a juſt alliance, moves her ſtrangely; and in the end Love wins her abſolutely: For although ſhe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, a property common enough to all her ſex, the impreſſion of <hi>Philippin</hi> had never been quite defaced in her ſoul; neither for deſpight, her affection having ſtill been ſtronger then the outrage, nor for another object; for after having failed of ſo high a deſign as the firſt, all other Matches were diſpleaſant to her, and her univerſal diſdain had loſt her many fortunes; nor for abſence, for amongſt the divertings of her many exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, always this Idea ſwam in her imaginations. So that it was eaſie for him to perſwade her, her own inclination import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her belief. Painting cannot laſt long; the firſt ſweating, it falls off a face that hath been daubed with it. The fained deſpight, the apparent cruelty, the artificious diſdain, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſcorn of this Damoſel, cannot be maintained long; for that which is counterfeited hath no ſolid ſubſtance, 'tis as ſnow before the ſun. After having kindled the fire of <hi>Philippin</hi> by a thouſand reproaches, there flew up a ſparkle from ſo many coals that lighted in her own heart, and burned herſelf. It happens ordinarily, that thoſe which ſhoot artificious fire are burnt firſt; and deſiring to endammage other, loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

The Bee never ſtings, but leaves the ſting in the wound; and in loſing her ſting, remains wounded to death. The fire of love is of that nature, that thoſe which will give love are taken; it is a game, in which who will take, are taken.

It is hard to give love, without receiving; 'tis ſo fine gold, as it remains always between the fingers of thoſe which diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it.

It was very eaſie for <hi>Philippin</hi> to deceive the eyes of his wife, <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Herman;</hi> having this intelligence with <hi>Iſabel,</hi> he thought himſelf above the clouds, being plunged into a foul quagmire. This proud Maid loved honour, and would never yield but with the hope of a future marriage. He importunes her, forced by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of his infamous deſires: But on the other ſide ſhe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſſed him to break with <hi>Eliſe,</hi> otherwiſe he ſhould not hope any thing of her but cruelty and diſdain. Here is <hi>Philippin</hi> in ſtrange convulſions: How ſhall he break this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred knot, to ſatisfie his unbridled appetite, and the tyrannie of this imperious Miſtreſs? This Mine muſt play by a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous clap. He yields extraordinary ſubmiſſion to her, and ſeems an Idolater; for all that ſhe comes no forwarder: He ſwears, proteſts and promiſes; but the ſecond oaths are refuſed by the example of the firſt. He paſſes to promiſes in writing; <hi>Iſabel</hi> receives them, but for all that he gets no forwarder in the ground of her honour. What ſhall he do to this infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xible creature? He reſolves to come to the worſt of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to repudiate <hi>Eliſe,</hi> ſending her ſhamefully from his houſe, breaking violently the laws of friendſhip, and brutally lets himſelf be carried by the torrent of a paſſion that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate him blindly in a misfortune irremediable. He ſees <hi>Iſabel</hi> every day; and with ſo much cunning of this falſe female, that her parents ſee their diſcourſes and meeting, without perceiving their practiſes, confounding by their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious carriages this word of the Oracle of truth, That he which doth ill hates light; for in the face of the ſun and ſight
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98576:34"/>
of men they diſſembled their ill doings. But blind and cruel <hi>Philippin</hi> began to uſe with much inhumanity the innocent <hi>Eliſe,</hi> that his inſolencies and indignities are no more ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a woman of her worth and quality. She deſires to know the ſubject of a uſage ſo rude as this was; but the more ſhe enquires, the more he hides it from her. All ſhe can do to give him content, diſpleaſes him; her preſence is ſo odious, that he can no longer ſuffer her. They ſay the Tygres, at the hearing of muſick, become more cruel. <hi>Philippin</hi> is of that humour; the ſweet harmony of the vertues of his wife makes him more ſavage and cruel: He now makes her to underſtand that he acknowledges her for no wife of his, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the violence of <hi>Timoleon</hi> to marry her: that he had nothing to do with her riches, ſhe might take them and be gone, for his houſe was great enough without her help: He reproaches her with her birth unequal to his, the baſeneſs of her parents, her ill faſhion, he calls her Courteſies coſenings. To be ſhort, he nouriſhes her with gall, and gives her vinegar to drink. Upon theſe ſubjects of nothing, he puts himſelf into exceſſive choler, and threatens to kill her if ſhe conſent not to the divorce.</p>
               <p>Imagine you if <hi>Eliſe,</hi> as wiſe and diſcreet as ſhe was, had patience to ſuffer ſo many affronts. She is his companion, and he uſes her as his ſlave; ſhe hath raiſed his houſe with her wealth, and is told ſhe is the ruine of it. Her eſtate of being great with child, doth it not make you pitty her? She endures nevertheleſs theſe taunts, theſe injuries, theſe threats, with a prodigious conſtancie, without anſwering ſo much as one word; not to throw oil on the fire by conteſting, deſiring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to quench it by the water of ſilence. Nor doth this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe this barbarous man, (for how would you have me call this obdurate <hi>Philippin?</hi>) He torments her horribly, being like a domeſtick Fury tyed to the neck of this Innocent. In the end affliction, that gives intelligence to the deafeſt ears, and like a biting powder or ſtrong water breaks open the ſtrongeſt lets that ſtop its paſſage, opens the ſecret of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to her, and makes her penetrate into the cheſt of darkneſs and into the counſel of perverſe hearts, the cauſe of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. She enters into herſelf, viſiting her interior Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem with a lamp, that is, a ſerious Examen; and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf guilty of any thing, ſhe ſees this change of <hi>Philippin</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:98576:35"/>
is cauſe of all her trouble; but conſiders not till it be too late the practiſes of <hi>Iſabel.</hi> She complains to <hi>Scevole</hi> and <hi>Sophie</hi> of the uſage of her husband, that could not longer be ſuffered; ſhe advertiſes <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Harman</hi> underhand to look to the carriage of this Maiden. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> declares this advice freely to <hi>Philippin;</hi> who knowing from whence it came, laught and mocked at it before her father, ſaying that was the jealouſie of his wife, that every ſhadow frighted. But he conceived ſuch a hatred, and was in ſuch a fury, as finding here a thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Lord of his quality, that he baſely ſtruck her, after having vomited all the outragious ſpeeches his paſſion could ſuggeſt againſt her. Which ſo ſeiſed this poor Lady with grief, as ſhe thought preſently to have dyed there. Too happy if it had ſo happened, ſhe had not then been reſerved ſor an end more tragick and ſhamefull.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Iſabel</hi> triumphs over all theſe debates, theſe being combats which promiſed her the victory. Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhe, that ſowes ſeeds of diſcord in this loyal marriage, troubling the higheſt ſerenity can be imagined. One thing troubles him, which is, the advertiſement <hi>Eliſe</hi> gave to <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Herman;</hi> which makes them more attentive on the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> whereby ſhe ſuffers ſtrangely, they watching her ſo neerly, fearing ſhe mould eſcape them, as ſeeing her equipages too knightly for a maiden, intend to ſend her far enough from <hi>Vaupre,</hi> to one of her Aunts, a woman much more ſevere then <hi>Valentine,</hi> where ſhe ſhould not have that liberty ſhe had in her fathers houſe. This makes her haſten the end of her deſign; and preſs the divorcing of <hi>Eliſe;</hi> to which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin</hi> by her perſwaſions is abſolutely reſolved. Why do I ſpin ſo long this mournfull cord? let us haſten to this ill ſtep. She advertiſes <hi>Philippin</hi> that they will remove her far from him; a journey which ſhe eſteems the tomb of her contentment, and the ruine of her pretenſions. He conjures her to come to <hi>Bellerive,</hi> for her coming to him would be the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> whom he will ſend to her friends with a bill of divorce; ſo that declaring his marriage null, he will never have other wife but her. This damoſel opens her ears to theſe perſwaſions; and baniſhing reaſon from her without ſhame, and making bankrupt her honour, ſhe thinks of nothing but to triumph on the ruines of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> upon the exile of whom ſhe pretends to erect the trophie of her contentments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98576:35"/>That which is feigned by the greateſt of Roman Poets touching the hunting in which the Queen of <hi>Carthage</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated hymeneal rights of marriage with the fair Trojan, is true in this our Hiſtory: For there is a match for hunting the Stag, where <hi>Philippin</hi> took a prey, letting himſelf be taken Stag and Slave of his foul deſires. This is the plot: <hi>Iſabel</hi> loſes herſelf in the woods, and doubly loſt both body and honour. But <hi>Philippin</hi> finds both the one and the other, and are loſt both in finding.

                  <hi>Herman</hi> who had the conduct of the aſſembly, troubled with this, judges it cannot be for any good. At their return ſhe is chidden: But ſhe more fool then ever in the love of <hi>Philippin,</hi> being ſo far engaged as ſhe muſt either dye in this pain, or end the marriage, without declaring to her brother her fault, tells him openly her intentions ſhe had to marry with <hi>Philippin,</hi> after he had broke his marriage with <hi>Eliſe. Herman</hi> ſhewed her it was a ſimple folly to think of that, all the ceremonies required for a legitimate marriage having been obſerved, and which is more, conſummated, ſo as <hi>Eliſe</hi> hath a daughter, and is great with another. He conjured her to put theſe thoughts out of her head, but it was too late; for this ſiſter of his ſtopping her ears at this wiſe counſel, like an aſp, vows ſhe muſt either die, or end it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herman</hi> ſeeing her ſo wilfull, fearing ſomwhat elſe might happen, preſſes his father to ſend away his ſiſter to his aunt, without telling him why, but rather caſting this advice upon the too frequent viſits of <hi>Philippin,</hi> which could not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by reaſon of his quality, and would make the world talk. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> reſolves, and commands his daughter to prepare her for the journey, alleadging ſome other ſlight conſiderations. But ſhe goes to make another: For one night being got on horſ-back, ſhe got to a place where <hi>Philippin</hi> ſtayed for her, who conducted her like a triumph to <hi>Bellerive,</hi> putting her in the ſame poſſeſſion of his houſe that ſhe had of his heart. In the morning <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> went to her chamber to diſpoſe of her parting, <hi>Herman</hi> being deſtined to conduct her, having all things in readineſs. There was much to do when they found
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98576:36"/>
her not; they know not what is become of her; <hi>Harman</hi> doubting, told his father freely, he thought ſhe was gone with <hi>Philippin.</hi> What alarms were there in this houſe! what an aſſault to the heart of her father! He tore his beard, and call'd himſelf unhappy to have put ſuch a daughter into the world, eſteeming them happy which are not charged with theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes ſo difficult and hard to be kept. He will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in his grief for his loſs; for he fears to find her without honour, rather then without life.</p>
               <p>This conjecture of <hi>Herman</hi> proves but too true; <hi>Iſabel</hi> is at <hi>Bellerive</hi> in the hands of <hi>Philippin.</hi> It is the abominable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in <hi>France,</hi> and in all this Province of which I ſpeak, for the leaſt wrong in the world that happens between Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to call one another to the field. Without being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe informed of the particulars of this buſineſs, <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> ſent by <hi>Herman</hi> a challenge to <hi>Philippin,</hi> to meet him in the field with his ſword in his hand, to do him right for having ſtollen his daughter, and to bring his ſecond, he having his ſon. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin</hi> for the firſt Preſent of his new marriage receives this bloody Paper; his courage commanded him to go, but his conſcience which gnaws him gives him fear. The Amazon hath the news, who offers (impudent and unnatural as ſhe is) to ſecond <hi>Philippin</hi> againſt her own father and brother, if there be occaſion; So true it is, that one forgetfulneſs brings on a hundred. But <hi>Philippin</hi> more reſerved then ſhe forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, being touched with a ſecret horror of this propoſition, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>Herman,</hi> That he pretends not to keep <hi>Iſabel</hi> in his houſe as a Concubine, but as his legitimate wife, being reſolved to ſend away <hi>Eliſe,</hi> and to declare his marriage null with her; beſeeching <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> to appeaſe his choler, and conſider that that which he eſteemed a diſhonour to his houſe, was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the higheſt advantage he could hope for his family; and that he would not upon a ſudden ligntneſs bloody his hands in the blood of him which honoured him already as his father-in-law: And imbracing <hi>Herman</hi> in quality of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo flatters him, as he returns him to <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> with theſe proteſtations. Who, furious like a Tygre that hath loſt her whelps, could not at firſt taſte theſe excuſes; demands his daughter, promiſing to give him her when the divorce of <hi>Eliſe</hi> was authoriſed by Juſtice, and his marriage declared illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and forced. <hi>Herman</hi> returns to <hi>Bellerive:</hi> but <hi>Iſabel</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:98576:36"/>
will not hear of this return, ſo that the fault was all in her; her father and brother are forced to mitigate their diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>Philippin,</hi> the rape having been voluntary on his daughters part.</p>
               <p>But whilſt they temporiſe with their Lord, what becomes of poor <hi>Eliſe?</hi> Without attending to be more outragiouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſhe intends to depart. For as one cannot ſerve two maſters, much leſs can a man have two wives. The Angel and the Dragon cannot endure together: The adulterer and the legitimate cannot be aſſociates in the kingdom of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous.</p>
               <p>Here is the contrary of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> The reproved ſupplants the raſed; darkneſs overcomes light, and vice triumphs proudly over innocence; <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his houſe by inſolent <hi>Hagar.</hi> At laſt <hi>Eliſe</hi> by an unheard of cruelty, without having leave to give her laſt farewell to her dear <hi>Philippin,</hi> s;aw herſelf with her daughter <hi>Dalimene</hi> ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſent from <hi>Bellerive,</hi> and conducted roughly by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, executors of her husbands paſſions, into the place of her birth, where full of grief ſhe flies into the arms of her parents. Here we ſee fulfilled that verſe in the Pſalm, <hi>Whilſt the proud exalt themſelves, the poor are in affliction:</hi> whilſt innocence is on the rack, the guilty are in their pride; and whilſt the Dove ſuffers, the Eagle raviſhed skips in the air of her vanity. <hi>Iſabel</hi> (as the Queen of <hi>Carthage</hi>) being returned from hunting, goes no more meditating with <hi>Philippin</hi> for their ſtollen meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; making defence of her confuſion, ſhe calls this ilformed practice Marriage, entituling with the honorable name of Wedding the miſerable torch of her impurity. <hi>Philippin</hi> himſelf would have it ſo, and calls her his wife.

And to accompliſh the meaſure of his inſolence, and to load with calamities the innocent <hi>Eliſe,</hi> he ſtrives to cover his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with a cloak of equity.

are the apparent reaſons with which this young Lord flatters himſelf, injured by this new paſſion that governs him. He imploys <hi>Herman's</hi> teſtimony of his firſt Promiſes, to break the ſecond. In which the brother of <hi>Iſabel</hi> ſeems very carefull, who looks not ſo much to the advantage of the match, as to the conſervation of the honour of his houſe; for his ſiſter had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately laid open the way to her ſhame, and permitted that which was neither lawful nor honeſt, but when a marriage is ſolemnly contracted in the face of the Church.</p>
               <p>But the wiſe <hi>Scevole,</hi> who hath all prudence and right in his thoughts, and is for his ſufficiencie of much eſteem and great authority in his company, underſtands well how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do this web, in ſuſtaining the honour of his daughter and his houſe; making it appear both by the ſpiritual and temporal Juſtice, that the firſt Promiſes of <hi>Philippin</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and of no effect, their Reſtitutions valuable, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncings authentical, and the marriage of <hi>Eliſe</hi> and <hi>Philippin</hi> validly contracted, and alſo the little <hi>Dalimene,</hi> with that ſhe went with, legitimate heirs of the one and the other. By theſe ſentences irrevocable, by theſe decrees of heaven and earth, <hi>Herman</hi> remains confuſed in this purſuit; <hi>Philippin</hi> deceived of his unjuſt pretenſions; <hi>Iſabel</hi> mocked and become the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the Country. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> ſeeing that by this lightneſs of his daughter, his houſe heretofore, although not rich in goods of fortune, yet rich in pride, was now all covered with ſhame and ignominy, not being able to contain his choler by his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, reſolves to take out this ſhamefull ſpot which diſhonours him, in the blood of the Complices; and calls <hi>Philippin</hi> the ſecond time to fight, but ſees himſelf diſdained as his vaſſal, and his quality of Gentleman rejected with an affront alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inſupportable to a great heart as his was. The affronted <hi>Iſabel</hi> made hard by impenitence, defends her fault, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in her evil, imputing the cauſe of the loſs of her cauſe not to the juſtice of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> but to the favour and authority of <hi>Scevole.</hi> She makes herſelf be called by the title of the houſe of <hi>Philippin,</hi> who commands his ſubjects to eſteem and honour her as his wife. Thus is verified the word of Truth it ſelf, that the impious being arrived at the depth of his malice, diſdains both honour and laws. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> outraged cruelly for the diſdain of <hi>Philippin,</hi> and for the inſolence of his daughter, and ſcorn and mockery of all their neighbours, not being able to digeſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98576:37"/>
all theſe indignities, falls into a terrible rage, and determines rather to loſe his life, then to draw it out with ſhame and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny. <hi>Philippin</hi> ſtands upon his guards; and being much aſſiſted according to his eminent quality, laughs at theſe poor Gentlemen, who do nothing but watch neer about his houſe to do him ſome miſchief; as a great maſtiff diſdains the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of little dogs about him. But being adviſed by ſome of his friends to beware of a ſurpriſe, or of ſome treaſon, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maſter of the life of the greateſt Monarch in the world, who will diſdain his own; not willing to live any longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe thorns and agonies, reſolves to change the air, and to carry <hi>Iſabel</hi> to <hi>Gold-mount.</hi> It is a ſure hold, a ſeat far off; he thinks to s;pend his dayes with more tranquillity. But as thoſe that are ſick at ſea, it avails them little to go from one ſhip to another; or he that hath the feaver in his veins, changes beds to no purpoſe; even ſo an ill conſcience carries always terror about him, fear and defiance follows him like the ſhadow the body. The guilty may well be in places of ſecurity, ſays a wiſe Antient, but not in aſſurance; for they always ſee the knife of vengeance divine or humane hanging and ſhaken over their heads; their ſleeps are troubled with a thouſand fearfull viſions, as if they had drunk the juice of the herb called <hi>Ophinſa.</hi> Their own thoughts ſerve them for a hangman, to torment them with horror of their faults, that they enjoy no quiet, but it paſſes ſuddenly from them. This far remove hath not appeaſed the rage of <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Herman,</hi> ſeconded in all his deſigns by him, which would not be appeaſed; theſe are the importunate ſtingings which ſhout threats and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive ſpeeches in the ears of <hi>Philippin,</hi> Theſe angry elfs which promiſe nothing leſs to themſelves, prick him to death, eſteeming they had reaſon to take the life of him that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed their honour; they make about <hi>Gold-mount</hi> a thouſand ſecret meetings, accompanied with ſtrangers, reſolving to ſpend the remnant of their fortunes in this quarrel. To the greateſt the leaſt enemies are redoubtable; there needs but a little Viper to pluck down a great Bull.

               <p>The whiles this miſerable Lord reſpires, if a man troubled with a thouſand fears within can have any repoſe, although freed of outward combats. We will take this time to go to the Town, to ſee what <hi>Eliſe</hi> doth; alſo the long ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous formality of the Eccleſiaſtical juſtice in theſe appeals, by reaſon of the diſtance of places, doth give us leiſure. She living retired with her father, under the wings of her mother <hi>Sophy,</hi> with as much will and obedience, as when ſhe was a Maid. Oh if ſhe had not tempred the rage of her fathers anger againſt <hi>Philippin,</hi> what would he not have done to have brought this deboiſt ſon-in-law to his duty and obedience? See but what a good diſpoſition ſhe is of, to procure all good to him which had uſed her ſo cruelly, and ſo ſhamefully ſent her away! But it may be her goodneſs was not commendable in this, for hindring the courſe of juſtice, which reduces ſometime to good the moſt deſperate, for fear of puniſhment. So that being pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and hoping that this fooliſh love would be paſt over quickly out of the fancy of this cruel man, whom though loſt as he was, ſhe loved as her life; ſhe inſpires patience into <hi>Scevole,</hi> although he had much ado to ſuffer theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.</p>
               <p>We have told you how ſhe was great with child; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe did not nouriſh the fruit in her body but with bread of grief and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98576:39"/>
to carry with herſelf that ſhe had brought forth, into the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre. Too happy <hi>Eliſe,</hi> if dying thus thou hadſt not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to a treſpaſs unworthy thy fair life! I will leave take to ſpeak of her excellent vertues which ſhe practiſed during this horrible travel, which ſhe thought ſhould have put her in her grave: what holy and Chriſtian thoughts ſuſtained her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage during theſe aſſaults? She receives all the Sacraments of the Church, with that devotion, that edified all thoſe which ſaw theſe actions; they thought their hearts would have cleft with pitty. She asks a thouſand pardons of her parents, filled with grief to ſee her in this eſtate: Committing to her ſiſter <hi>Leonore</hi> the pardon ſhe demanded of <hi>Philippin,</hi> whoſe cruelties ſhe even honoured in this extreme agony. She loſt ſo much blood, as ſhe thought verily to have rendred up her ſoul by this flux, the Phyſitians believing no leſs. But as this languiſhing death is rather tedious then violent, leaving their judgments, with a great clearneſs and underſtanding, ſhe had leiſure to write this Letter in her extremities, which ſhe would have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with her blood, to touch with pitty the inſenſible heart of her welbeloved Adverſary; VVe will report it thus.</p>

It is long ſince I would have left my life, if the laws of God had not forbid my paſſage, which I go to free with as little grief, as life (being deprived of your favour) is pleaſing to me.

have done to me rigorouſly, I feel is full of equity and juſtice. So that examining my conſcience upon the duties I was bound to give you, and finding my ſelf not guilty of any thing, I think that for a puniſhment of my other ſins God hath permitted you to take my reſpects for wrongs, and my humilities for outrages. Had I been treated in the form of offenders, I ſhould have underſtood the cauſe of my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before undergone: But I was ſtruck with thunder before the lightning appeared, and ſooner condemned then heard. The which I ſay not to complain, for fear to turn this complaint into an offence, to hurt you in thinking to s;atisfie you; humbly asking pardon for all I have failed in to your ſervice. For although my duty and condition bound me to give you all ſort of obedience and fidelity, it is true, I was more carried by my love then for any other conſideration of civil reſpect, I think (without vanity) being the creature in the world which hath beſt loved you, and which thinks not to have given other ſubject to offend you, but the exceſs of her ardent affection.</p>
                  <p>But almoſt the perfection of love is in exceſs: who ſees not but this fault carries its excuſe in its accuſation, and if blamed is commendable. It may be if ſhe had not been ſo fervent in affection, you had eſteemed her more; but her extremity made you leſs accept it; ſo that you have no way heretofore comprehended it, but like a weak vapour diſperſed as ſoon as riſen, ſince in a moment it is dead in your remembrance. Alas, what is become of that happy time, in which not having other care but to pleaſe you, you ſeemed to ſtudy nothing but to content me, in yielding me love for love, in which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the feaſt of our felicities! Whither are thoſe fair dayes gone, in which you received no contentment but by my me, nor did any thing but by my counſel; as I lived not but for you, nor breathed not but to pleaſe you! Times and dayes too happy, and whereof the ſweet enjoying is converted for a fault to my memory. Alas! muſt I for having been inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, be ſo lightly changed! and a fading beauty, with ſo little conſideration, be preferred before a ſolid goodneſs!

beyond my merit, if I may do you ſervice by my death, by making the unjuſt legitimate. Of all my ills I accuſe my ill fortune, not attributing them to any but to my own faults; not deſerving of you but that juſt hatred with which you have purſued my indignities. That which comforts me in the griefs that bury me, is, that the cauſe of my ſufferings lightens my grief. I apprehend only that this paper ſoils not with ſome ſhadow of reproach, and with ſome touch of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, ſo many perfection as I have always loved and honoured in your perſon, for which the leaſt ſupportable rigors have ſeemed not only tolerable, but ſweet, my affection ſweetening their bitterneſs.</p>
                  <p>I will not repreſent the pains I now endure, being they ſever the miſeries of my ſoul and body: but I aſſure you they ſeem far lighter to me then thoſe I felt, when by your command I was ſeparated from you; and then I had more underſtanding to feel it, then now to expreſs it. It Would be to offend their extremities, to think to ſpeak them: And if they might be reſiſted, I would not; for that being of a nature communicable, their contagion might paſs into your ſoul by conpaſſion; and I deſire that my death may be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of rejoycing to you. Permit me only to qualifie all the injuries the world eſteems you have done me, with the title of good; renouncing the reward due to all the ſervices I have rendred you; ſo that ſatisfying my paſſion in ſerving you, I have contented my ſelf: it lies not in me that you loſe not the remembrance; if it troubles never ſo little your joy, if my humilities are of any conſideration before you, methinks they will deſerve the credit to be forgot. So much I fear (as nothing more) that the image of my imperfections ſhould again trouble your fancy: For I believe, if there reſts any feeling in bones laid in the tomb, the tranquility of mine will be troubled, if I thought that pitty might find place in your heart, which I have experimented ſo void of love; what a pain would it be to me, if I believed only that you would grieve for having killed me? For although I ought not to deſire a fairer monument then the thoughts of your ſoul, yet acknowledging my unworthineſs, I dare not apprehend ſo ſtately an incloſure, becauſe I know I ſhould not reſt without cauſing your unquietneſs. I'll content my ſelf with the glory that I die for you, if I dare ſay for you; for ſince that I lived
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98576:41"/>
but, for you, is it not giving you that which I owe, that I render you my life? Nor is this death preſented to taxe you, or to change into wrong to you, that which to me is a high degree of honour; only I ſhew you with all kind of humility, that if in honouring you I have been ſo unhappy to diſpleaſe you, I have not been ſo miſerable to offend you. Your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhall be ſuch as you pleaſe; but it ſhall be permitted me to believe, that as I could not addreſs my avows to a more accompliſhed ſubject, perhaps hereafter you may more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge: And although this effect hath not ſeconded my intention, my intention hath had nevertheleſs its effect, which had no other deſign but to teſtifie my fidelity. I know well, that in all I have done but what I ought: but as I think not to have failed, ſo it muſt be confeſſed, that giving all I ought to whom I ought all, is no little proof of zeal. Happy if I had ſhewed by the loſs of my life, that of the holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which you have ſworn before God and his Angels. Be happy at leaſt in my diſaſter, to have endured without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that you would have me ſuffer. Live from henceforth free by my death; leaving me this contentment in my miſery, to believe that it brings you comfort. <hi>I</hi> will endure it, in honouring you: All that comes from your hands, cannot but be received by me. I adore the hand of God, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects me by yours; which mingles gall with that too much honey I taſted in poſſeſſing of you, and ſevers me from all delights of the world, to make me aſpire to the eternal. At leaſt, dear <hi>Philippin,</hi> acknowledg my fidelity in this ſincere teſtimony that I render you, To honour even your cruelty to the laſt period of my life, and to cheriſh your diſdain in the midſt of the pangs of death.</p>
                  <p>I ought to do it, ſince I confeſs <hi>I</hi> did not deſerve ſo great an alliance as you, <hi>I</hi> was not worthy but of your refuſe. <hi>I</hi> had conſented to my repudiation, if the Chriſtian laws in this caſe were not inviolable, eſpouſing a Monaſtery to leave you at liberty in your deſires; but honour and juſtice have withſtood it, nor could <hi>I</hi> obtain of my father to give you this contentment to the prejudice of me and my fame. If <hi>I</hi> did preſume in taking that great honour to be your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, not deſerving the title of the meaneſt of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, think but with your ſelf what command my friends might have of me a Maiden, ſince your father (the memory
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98576:41"/>
of whom is a bleſſing to me) had ſo abſolute a power on your will. This is to the end you may excuſe not ſo much my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as my obedience; and amongſt the illuſtrious dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which honour you, and of which I participated, you know I never did forget my ſelf, nor have thought to be but what I was. From henceforth I quit this place too great for me, to that happy Creature which poſſeſſes you. I am not to acknowledge her merits, yet eſteem your judgment in your election; not only excuſing your change, but approving it: For although I yield to her all the preheminencies of grace and beauty; as long as I live, I will never yield either to her, or to any perſon in the world, that of affection; that if ſhe be better beloved of you then I was, you ſhall never be by her, as you have been and are ſtill by me, now that death breaks our firſt bonds, rendring the ſecond as I deſire them more pleaſing; the ſplendor of this fair day will ſhine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, after the obſcurity of my night. My will would have procured you this marriage during my life, to have pleaſed you, and have been a purchaſer of my own ruine, by ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing it againſt my ſelf. But it is in vain for us to wraſtle againſt the laws of God.</p>
                  <p>All that tears ſighs from me, and troubles the clearneſs of my conſtancie in theſe extremes, is the loſs of this poor Infant; which as fruit diſgraced, is fallen by the wind of your anger from the arch which bore it; ſeeing it could not ripen under the rays of your favour, it hath ſeen the night of death before the day of life, being deprived of the light of the ſtar, which only could have illuſtrated his darkneſs. But that moſt afflicts me, is this little innocent <hi>Dalimene,</hi> which I leave on the earth the ſubject of your diſdains. For Gods love, dear <hi>Philippin!</hi> let not the indignity of the Mother prejudice the fortune of this poor creature; ſince heaven would, to ſhew you how ſtrongly your idea was graven in my heart, that ſhe bears in her forehead the lively image of thoſe graces that nature hath ſtamped on yours, not having any ſign of thoſe defects which have deprived me of the happineſs of your love. Let her childiſh voice move you to pitty; and ſince ſhe is blood of your blood, in her have compaſſion, not of her, nor me, but of your ſelf.</p>

She gives thanks to heaven, as if it had been guilty of her fault, and bound to repair it by ſo bloody a means; by which you may note the humours of theſe creatures, that are many times ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent to mingle divinity with their miſdeeds. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently advertiſed at <hi>Vaupre,</hi> who much rejoices for the enſuing wedding of his daughter; and the houſe of <hi>Philippin</hi> in ſtead of wearing blacks for the deceaſe of their Miſtreſs, are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in feaſting and joy of a nuptial pomp, to honour a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with ſmall honour conſummated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philippin</hi> receives a double joy by this death, ſeeing himſelf delivered of her, which he could not have been but by it; and in poſſeſſion of her, which he could not make his legitimate wife as long as <hi>Eliſe</hi> had lived. He ſaw himſelf poſſeſſed with great wealth by <hi>Scevole,</hi> by the means of <hi>Dalimene;</hi> which if he ſhould have reſtituted or been deprived of, would have been his utter ruine. He imagines to be gotten above all his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: And as the loadſtone hath no force to draw to it that iron that is rubbed with garlick, even ſo his heart invironed with the ſtinking garlick of diſhoneſt voluptuouſneſs, cannot be moved to any pitty towards poor <hi>Eliſe,</hi> whoſe love trains her to death.
<q>
                     <l>Accurſed be the flames and plots of thoſe</l>
                     <l>Projectors, who ſo fruitleſly expoſe</l>
                     <l>Themſelves to plots ſo abortive and forlorn,</l>
                     <l>They die before they are begot or born.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:98576:43"/>For as they were preparing for theſe nuptial feaſts with great diligence, news came to them of the recovery of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> which turned all their joy into ſmoke, and buried all their deſigns. Oh how vain and light is humane underſtanding! <hi>Philippin</hi> hates the life of her, whom he lamented being dead: <hi>Iſabel</hi> is in deſpair, <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> in fury, and <hi>Herman</hi> afflicted, all deceived, becauſe prevented of their hopes and pretenſions. Certainly God would have it ſo, and reſerve <hi>Eliſe</hi> for misfortunes more cruel, to make his glory ſhine on the depth of an apparent ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie.</p>
               <p>But the rage of <hi>Philippin</hi> reſts not there: For being preſſed by <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> to keep his word with him, having removed his Appeal to <hi>Rome</hi> to make that ſentence void which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his marriage with <hi>Eliſe;</hi> he imploies his uttermoſt means to remove all lets and hindrances to prove it of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not forgetting any diligence or earneſtneſs in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit thereof. But if he were a violent undertaker, he hath to do with a better defendant: For <hi>Scevole</hi> being upheld by the moſt equitable right in the world, knew better how to handle theſe Proceſs-weapons then himſelf. This hinders not nevertheleſs but this labyrinth of conteſtations ingenders a marvellous long proceeding, during which years ſlide away. <hi>Philippin</hi> is always in poſſeſſion of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> by whom he had ſome children, which were brought up as legitimate. The whilſt he is loſt in his debauches, and by theſe ill proceedings offends again with new outrages the goodneſs of the chaſte <hi>Eliſe;</hi> which cruel perſecution carries him to an action more inconſiderate then malicious, and which will coſt him his life.</p>
               <p>You muſt underſtand, that <hi>Eliſe</hi> being a Maid had been ſought in marriage by a Gentleman well qualified, and of a reasonable good eſtate; whom we will call <hi>Andronico,</hi> for ſome reaſons which make this name proper to him, of which this is the principal, that among his qualities he had one which drew his title from the Apoſtle who was brother to S. <hi>Peter;</hi> with this being very valiant, having had many encounters in which he was ſtill victorious; this name methinks agrees well, to make all theſe things darkly underſtood. This young <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronico,</hi> after a long purſuit, becauſe of a ſecret diſlike <hi>Scevole</hi> had of men of the ſword, not willing to give his daughter but to a ſon of his own gown, as he had done before his eldeſt;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98576:44"/>
being now at the point to obtain his deſire, the diſpoſitions of the parents of <hi>Eliſe</hi> gave him hope of a happy ſucceſs, his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and perſeverance having won them. Now <hi>Timoleon</hi> coming on theſe terms, and offering to <hi>Scevole Philippin</hi> his ſon, an alliance ſo great and high, this of <hi>Andronico</hi> vaniſhed like a ſtar before the ſun. <hi>Andronico</hi> digeſted this bitterneſs with a patience which may be better praiſed then expreſt: He makes great complaints, which the wind blows away. Challenge <hi>Philippin</hi> he cannot; for why, the greatneſs and authority of <hi>Timoleon</hi> threw too much duſt and powder before his eyes, and it would have been to ſet a Wren againſt an Eagle. An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable retreat ſeems more advantagious then a needleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. Well, he retires to his houſe, not without leaving <hi>Eliſe</hi> in ſome kind of ſorrow, which under the permiſſion of a juſt reſearch, was far advanced in her favour, and could not be left without grief. Yet <hi>Andronico</hi> having at firſt ſought her for the reſpect of wealth, had now by long frequentation obſerved in her many vertues, and lodged them deeply in his heart, letting her gain much in his beſt affection. I will not ſpread my ſelf too far in the patticularities of their mutual loves, not to take from this Hiſtory its brevity. So it is, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronico</hi> yields where he could not diſpute with the greatneſs of his Competitor; and <hi>Eliſe</hi> inſtructed by her mother to have no other will but that of her parents, yields to the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Philippin,</hi> rather for obedience then any inclination; and <hi>Scevole</hi> imitating the dog in the fable, leaves a ſmall body for a great ſhadow, loſing both the one and the other; ſo weak and feeble is our humane wiſdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eliſe</hi> being <hi>Philippins,</hi> giving him her body, and with it her heart abſolutely to love him, as an honeſt wife ought to do a husband, blotting from her thoughts all the impreſſions ſhe had of <hi>Andronico;</hi> and he having loſt all hope to enjoy her, loſt alſo the deſign of purſuing any further. But as a man ſleeping is not dead, nor a fire out that is covered with aſhes; even ſo this love rejoiced to awake and lighten in theſe young hearts, which a holy amitie had heretofore tied in a mutual bond. <hi>Eliſe</hi> being thus ſeparated from <hi>Philippin</hi> (as you have ſeen) and returned to her parents; <hi>Andronico,</hi> who was ordinarily in the town, expecting ſome good match, ſees her at her fathers, where his own worth gave him free acceſs; at which ſight he feels ſome ſparks of his firſt flame. At firſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98576:44"/>
it was without deſign, and rather for a kind of civility then otherwiſe; yet he after continues his viſits by inclination and pleaſure that he takes in the converſation of this creature; of whoſe pittiful misfortunes he conceives as much compaſſion, as he had heretofore been paſſionate for her. And becauſe love enters not into the ſoul by any gate ſo wide as that of condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the extreme misfortunes of poor <hi>Eliſe</hi> made and ample breach in the heart of this young Gentleman, who doubtleſs loved her truly, yet with all the honour and reſpect that might be deſired of a man which made profeſſion of vertue. But this entertainment went ſo far, that <hi>Eliſe</hi> lets herſelf be carried to yield to the entertainments of <hi>Andronico,</hi> being alſo much pleaſed in his converſation, which was full of diſcretion and modeſty, example of his ends and pretenſions, that renders rather marcenarie then true theſe worldy friendſhips. They lived like brother and ſiſter, enjoying a pure and perfect uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as there is nothing ſo precious in a great affliction, as to find a confident friend, in whoſe breaſt one may impoſe their griefs, and which partakes of our ills by an unfained cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; <hi>Eliſe</hi> eſteems it her happineſs to have met with <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico,</hi> to whom ſhe communicates her griefs with a holy and innocent confidence; and he on the other ſide took ſuch part, that <hi>Eliſe</hi> receives a marvellous conſolation; for by his words and reaſons he tempred the ſharp points which augmented the ſmart of this diſaſter, withal having a certain grace in his ſpeech that made his counſels and conſolations very commendable. If <hi>Eliſe</hi> complain of the rigorous uſage of <hi>Philippin,</hi> his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cruelty; <hi>Andronico</hi> blames this fierce cruelty, and judges him unworthy to enjoy ſo great a goodneſs as hers; ſaying that the love of <hi>Eliſe</hi> was too ſincere for a ſubject ſo full of ingratitude; and that if ſhe had not yielded to him ſo much, he would have more reſpected her, and not given her this ill uſage.</p>
               <p>I ſhall never have done, if I ſhould undertake to repreſent their diſcourſe and entertainments, which made them eſteem the hours as ſhort as minutes, in which they were preſent one with the other; and a moment of abſence ſeemed infinite ages. Thus by little and little the ſympathie of their diſpoſitions made them find themſelves tied in knot indiſſoluble, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever paſsing in this their frequentation (which was always in the preſence of either <hi>Sophie</hi> or <hi>Scevole</hi>) any action, word
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98576:45"/>
or thought, directly or indirectly contrary to purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. Their eyes were of doves, waſhed in the milk of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and whiteneſs; their lips bound with a ſcarlet ribbon, ſo full of puritie was their diſcourſe; with hands full of myrrhe (preſervative againſt corruption) were exempt of impurity; their hearts and bodies breathed nothing but modeſt. How often both <hi>Scevole</hi> and <hi>Sophie,</hi> ſeeing this commendable amity, grieved they had not joined them in marriage according to their firſt intent! But repentance came too late, the dice are thrown.

               </p>
               <p>The whilſt theſe unadviſed parents conſidered not they threw oil on the fire that their youths kindled, though ſhe covers it with a vail of chaſte modeſtie; this gave liberty to <hi>Eliſe</hi> to deſire <hi>Andronico,</hi> if ſhe had been free from the ſlaviſh tyrannie of <hi>Philippin:</hi> ſhe reproves often the ambition of her parents, who had been cauſe of her fall by an aſcent too high; how much more ſweet appears a mediocrit fortune, then thoſe ſo eminent, which like the fate of huge rocks are ſooner ſtruck thunder then the humble vallies; conſidering

               <p>
                  <hi>Andronico</hi> gathers theſe plants as pearls from roſes, for he was not without tears, making ruddie the plants of his deſires, and curſing his ill fortune, which made them acceptable now out of ſeaſon, and were refuſed when receivable. Till when, ſays he, O confounder of vertue, and my ſworn enemy! wilt thou perſecute me?
<q>
                     <l>Remorſeleſs Fate then mercileſs will move</l>
                     <l>In oppoſition to impede my Love.</l>
                  </q>
But then coming to himſelf, and ſeeing that under theſe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical names of fortune and deſtinie he taxed the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, under whom ſlides the thread of out days, and which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98576:45"/>
holds our being in his hands; reſolves to adore rather then to outrage; and full of confidence, flatters himſelf with ſome aiery hope by theſe words:
<q>
                     <l>If Heaven on my forſaken head</l>
                     <l>The influence of his Grace ſhall ſhed,</l>
                     <l>In melting ſhowrs, and once more ſhine</l>
                     <l>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this drooping ſoul of mine:</l>

                     <l>The morn, and turn my winter into ſpring.</l>
                  </q>
But why do I delay ſo long to let you ſee the rock of precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the end of ſcandal, and ſhelf of ſhipwrack of theſe ſouls, in effect innocents, yet in appearance will become horrible guilty. Alas! the bird which produces the feather is taken; and the Eagle oftentimes furniſhes the feather which makes the arrow that wounds her to death. After they had long figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one anothers ears their griefs, and curſed their miſerable condition which had hindred their being one anothers; after having many times deſired that <hi>Philippin</hi> had been <hi>Iſabels,</hi> and <hi>Andronico Eliſe's;</hi> the laws, which are not always confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the deſires of Lovers, were found to contradict theſe alliances; for the knot which God ties, cannot be cut but by the axe of death. After many reciprocal words of good will, followed with a thouſand proteſtations to enjoy one another in marriage, if death in puniſhing the perfidies of <hi>Philippin</hi> would give way to their loves; after many Letters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame language, coming ſo forward, falling by little and little into pits, which in ſtead of ſnaring drew them out at length to ſtrangle them; that they made reciprocal promiſes one to the other, which could have no other ground but the death of <hi>Philippin;</hi> which neither the one nor the other had any thought to procure by any way, but to attend it by the hand of God.</p>
               <p>Here is all their fault: And certainly 'tis true, vertuous <hi>Eliſe,</hi> that by a vain aſſurance of fidelity, which will be as ſtrongly tied to your heart as to the paper, you put in great hazard both your honour and life. This was the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and end of <hi>Andronico's</hi> deſigns; for he knew too well the humour of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> to pretend of her any thing which was not honorable; nothing paſſing between them of that which this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98576:46"/>
honeſt wife ought to her legitimate, although barbarous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; for ſhe had her purity in ſuch a recommendation, that modeſty ruled not only her actions and words, but alſo her thoughts. O muſt ſhe, to prevent the title of ingratitude, which could not have been given but by the mouth of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronico,</hi> fall into ſuch an imprudence, which will make her die in the ſight of all the world in quality of an infamous adulterer and bloody homicide of her own husband, although in effect or in will ſhe was no ways guilty.</p>
               <p>Thus a ſparkle ſometime blown far, increaſes to a great fire; and a ſmall hurt neglected, becomes an incurable ulcer; a little ſpring increaſing to a flood, runs with a large compaſs into the ſalt ſea. But how ſhall this Promiſe be diſcovered, which ſhould not ſee the day, but when the ſun ſhould leave to ſee <hi>Philippin</hi> on earth? Yet you will underſtand it by a means, that will force you to cry with the great Apoſtle, O height of riches of the wiſdom of God, whoſe judgments are incomprehenſible, and his wayes unſearchable! The whilſt <hi>Philippin</hi> is at <hi>Gold-mount,</hi> in Poſſeſſion of the body of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> with whom he conſumes his days in abominable and unlawfull delights, gilding his evils with the fair name of marriage, and by a falſe malicious conſcience eſteeming her his wife: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronico</hi> is in the town in poſſeſſion of the heart of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> who laments no more the abſence of <hi>Philippin,</hi> by enjoying the preſence of <hi>Andronico;</hi> their converſations all pure and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, have nothing that the moſt ſevere cenſurers can juſtly blame; and living under the eye and diſcipline of a <hi>Sophie,</hi> who truſted not ſo much her daughter, as that ſhe had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an eye on her converſation.</p>
               <p>Thus whilſt the Proceſs of <hi>Philippin</hi> for diſſolving his marriage is drawn out ſtill longer, ('tis a web cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled) <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> enraged by theſe dalays, murmurs and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to kill <hi>Philippin,</hi> if he purſues it not to an iſſue, as he had promiſed him. So that the ſollicitation of this buſineſs calls <hi>Philippin</hi> to town, having many points in his cauſe which could not be decided but in his preſence, beſides that he could have no better Sollicitor then himſelf. Being thus imployed, in all companies whereſoever he came, he was ſtill ſpeaking invective words againſt <hi>Scevole</hi> and his daughter, which made him odious to all that heard him: For, wronging her whom all held his wife, was it not to gather filth to cover his head, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98576:46"/>
to throw hot burning coals in his own face? He was then doubly blamed and mocked of thoſe which knew the integrity of the father, and worth of the mother of vertuous <hi>Eliſe;</hi> who attributed all theſe words to the lightneſs of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nouriſhed in vice, and rotten in his debauches. But when many times his wiſeſt friend would reproach him with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie, preſenting to him the ill opinion which was ſpread in the world of this vile life he lived with <hi>Iſabel;</hi> in ſtead of taking theſe admonitions with the right hand, he receives them with the left, is diſpleaſed with theſe truths, or turns them to laughter, rejoicing in his misfortune and vice, and glorying in his ills. For many time in the company of Ladies, where he was for this moſt perſecuted, in a vain humour he deſcribes the graces of his <hi>Diana,</hi> and deciphers (what ſhall I ſay?) rends the ill form of poor <hi>Eliſe.</hi> He makes them ſee that all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the art of well-ſpeaking, have nothing that gives greater eloquence then paſsion: For as love made him fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in one ſubject, hatred makes him as wild in the other; having a voice equally ſtrong to praiſe and blame, exceſsive in both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andronico</hi> frequents, as well as he, theſe companies, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed whereſoever, for being full of worthy parts that made him commendable; which he accompanied with as much wiſdom and ſtaidneſs, as <hi>Philippin</hi> ſhewed lightneſs. He hears ſometimes recited the indiſcreet diſcourſe of this Lord, who ſpake without puniſhment what he pleaſed: And being pricked in the tendreſt part of his affection, knowing the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> could not ſuffer they ſhould be ſo cruelly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the tongue of <hi>Philippin.</hi> But as then fearing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his love in ſuſtaining this innocence, finds himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into ſtrange agonies: Nevertheleſs at the aſſault of theſe reports, which took him ſometimes on the ſudden, he could not contain himſelf from replying as ſharp and biting words againſt <hi>Philippin,</hi> as he received ſweet from <hi>Eliſe:</hi> ſometime accuſing him of backbiting and indiſcretion, and often of falſhood, ſaying that <hi>Scevole</hi> wanted not friends to ſuſtain the contrary of that he ſo unworthily ſought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; ſometimes affirming it was a ſhame for a Cavalier to have to do with one of the Gown, and more to tail againſt a Woman, who had no other arms but her tears; many times for mirth makes Satyrs of <hi>Iſabel</hi> not only to his noſe, but alſo with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98576:47"/>
the pen: He Writ certain verſes againſt her, and long ones; but becauſe they were too biting, I would not black this paper with then. Often in defending <hi>Eliſe,</hi> he publiſhes her worth and patience, ſaying that <hi>Philippin</hi> abuſed her goodnes, was not worthy of ſuch a wife; for in following the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his marriage, he ſought his own ruine and ſhame: His ruine, for without the wealth of <hi>Scevole</hi> his houſe remains engaged without hope of recovery; his ſhame, in having married one he covers with infamie and diſhonour. And for the inſupportable diſdain that pride drew from the ſpirit of <hi>Philippin</hi> againſt the family of <hi>Scevole,</hi> he ſaid that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in condition made him not leſs noble; Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing during peace, that which Military art is during wars: That if Nobility were drawn from its firſt and moſt juſt meaſure, which is Vertue, it would be found greater of the fathers ſide then of the ſon-in-law's: That according to the courſe of the world, a new Nobility accompanied with great riches, ought to be in as great eſteem as an antient boaſting under miſerable poverty. As the wind carries often a ſmall ſparkle here and there, which at length is cauſe of great flames; ſo there want not in the world reporters, which like Smiths bellows ſerve to light and kindle cholers, and to put fire into mens courages. The ſpeeches of <hi>Andronico</hi> come by theſe means to the proud ears of <hi>Philippin,</hi> who at firſt began to carry himſelf with threats, appearing as a cowardly dog that barks more then bites. It was true, that for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and greatneſs of deſcent, <hi>Andronico</hi> was much the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior; yet was he a Gentleman, and of a deſcent too good to endure any thing unworthy. When <hi>Philippin</hi> ſpake of a cudgel, he replied he would anſwer him with a blade of ſteel; and being born a Gentleman, might meaſure his ſword with any man that wore iron at his ſide.</p>
               <p>By an ill encounter they met in a company; where at the firſt ſight, after the lightning of looks, ſucceeds the thunder of words, and had come to the hail of blows, if they had not been by the multitude of their friends parted. <hi>Andronico</hi> not having loſt any thing in this encounter, retains himſelf within modeſty; but furious <hi>Philippin</hi> foaming with rage, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges him with as much noiſe, as ſmall effect: For it was never in their powers to meet; the Juſtice having ſet guards on them, and the Governour deſirous to agree them, had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98576:47"/>
ſtraitly forbid them fighting. The whilſt <hi>Philippin,</hi> beſides the ſpight to ſee himſelf braved by a man he thought not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be his ſervant, redoubling his injuries not only againſt <hi>Scevole</hi> and <hi>Eliſe,</hi> but alſo againſt <hi>Andronico;</hi> obliges his patience to return ſharp replies. <hi>Philippin</hi> enquires from whence this humour of <hi>Andronico</hi>'s ſhould proceed, to ſuſtain ſo ardently the cauſe of <hi>Eliſe:</hi> And having learned his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary frequenting the houſe of <hi>Scevole,</hi> with ſome addition by the calumnious reporter, as it is ordinary, adding ſomething to flatter his paſſion; we need not ask if he added to the letter. As thoſe which are ill, think all are like themſelves, he accuſes her of diſhonour, who was as innocent as he guilty; calling ordinarily <hi>Andronico,</hi> in mockery, the Squire of <hi>Eliſe;</hi> a word in apparence ſimple, but furred with black malice, and to be underſtood as ſharp as it appeared ſubtile.</p>
               <p>The courteous <hi>Andronico</hi> turning to laughter theſe mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſaid, his madneſs made him ſpit at heaven, and his own filth returned on his head. Which was true: for if <hi>Eliſe</hi> had been ſuch as <hi>Philippin</hi> had deſcribed her, and his marriage with her not yet declared null; who ſees not that that which he ſaid to diſhonour her, returned infamy on himſelf? But in that he ſhot his arrow at a rock, which returns to hurt him that ſhot it. And <hi>Andronico,</hi> to ſhew he wanted not wit nor ſpirit to defend himſelf with a tongue, more then the other that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed him; would ſay, that if he had lived in the time of the antient Palatines, which made profeſſion to revenge the wrongs done by the ſtrongeſt to the weakeſt, as alſo to defend the afflicted innocent, and principally to vindicate the honour of Ladies, he would eaſily have been drawn to the field as <hi>Eliſe's</hi> Knight, to make known by a victory the juſtice of this Lady, ſo unjuſtly accuſed and unworthily uſed by her barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous husband.</p>

               <p>A Gentleman of <hi>Philippin's,</hi> whom we will call <hi>Valfran,</hi> mad to ſee his Maſter could not be revenged of a meaner then himſelf, reſolves on a baſe and unworthy act, which was to ſhoot a piſtol at the head of <hi>Andronico.</hi> He takes his time, and as day was ſhut in, (for theſe ſhamefull actions require darkneſs) having learnt he was in a company where he paſſed his time in hearing a pleaſing Conſort of muſick; he ſent to him by one of his Lacquays, ſaying he was to ſpeak with him from the Lord <hi>Philippin,</hi> and would attend him at the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door. The Lacquay tells his Maſter ſecretly; who full of the furious courage of our French Nation, that eſteems moſt valor in ſingle Combats, although it be nothing but brutality; and dead with envy to ſee this Rodomonts ſword in his hand, hoping to abate his pride, and make his day by his death to the promiſe of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> ſteals ſubtilly from his company, as if he would but go into another chamber; and ſtepping to the door, he no ſooner appeared, but the traiterous murderer which attended him with his foot firm, without ſaying any word, preſents his piſtol to his head. <hi>Andronico</hi> ſlips quickly aſide, and ſo happily, that the blow given with a noiſe (ſuch as you may judge) againſt the door, burſt it like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Hereat all the houſe and neighbourhood is in alarms; the Conſort ceaſes, and yields to this helliſh muſick. The murderer would have drawn his ſword; but <hi>Andronico</hi> throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf reſolutely upon him, rolls him down the ſtairs. Above and below were many blows given; the Lacquays cry murder; all run to the reſcue of <hi>Andronico;</hi> but the place was ſo ſtrait, that the ſword of <hi>Valfran</hi> was of no uſe. <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico</hi> is altogether unarmed; who perceiving the murderer ſought his poniard to offend him, having more ſtrength gets it, and holding it to his throat, ſays, Remember thou miſt me, but I will not fail thee; and ſtrikes it twice or thrice into his body. The murderer cries out fearfully: He would have ended him; but deſirous to know from whence this ſhould come, he leaves him yet with ſome part of life. <hi>Andronico's</hi> friends came with their ſwords in their hands, and thinking this enterpriſe was followed, run up and down the ſtreets to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98576:48"/>
find out the Complices of <hi>Valfran:</hi> but finding none, the Juſtice is ſent for, into whoſe hands the Traitor is remitted; who confeſſed in the place, that he was incited to this baſe act (unworthy a Gentleman as he was) becauſe he ſaw his Maſter could not meet <hi>Andronico</hi> to end their quarrel; and that he could not endure that a meaner then his maſter ſhould reſiſt him ſo ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philippin</hi> advertiſed of this accident, loving <hi>Valfran</hi> as much as he hated <hi>Andronico,</hi> knows not of which ſide to range himſelf: For if he ſuſtain the traitor, he covers himſelf with ſhame and infamy, and although he proteſt, will be thought partaker in the treaſon; and to renounce him, would be to imbrace the cauſe of his enemy, and abandon his friend. But honour bears him above friendſhip; and blaming this way as altogether ſhamefull and illbecoming a generous courage, he diſavows <hi>Valfran,</hi> yet beſeeches the Juſtice to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with his wounds, without putting him to a ſhamefull death. But they were found ſuch, as they prevented the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of juſtice; for three days after he dyed: God, by a ſecret pitty, giving him that time to acknowledg his faults, which he did, demanding a thouſand pardons of <hi>Andronico</hi> for his attempt; and underſtanding the diſavow of <hi>Philippin,</hi> which had left him in the point of his greateſt neceſſity, cries, O how great is the ingratitude of worlings! how frail their ſtrength, whoſe amity is enmity to that of God's!</p>
               <p>This death ſhewed the juſtice of God, which leaves no evil unpuniſhed, increaſed juſtice in men, ſatisfied <hi>Andronico,</hi> purged <hi>Philippin;</hi> and by this example teaches us the truth of the celeſtial oracle ſpoken by the mouth of King <hi>David</hi> in his Pſalm,

This raiſed marvellouſly the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Andronico;</hi> who was quitted for ſtabbing of <hi>Valfran.</hi> Oh how much did <hi>Eliſe</hi> find herſelf bound to him for all this! how much love did ſhe proteſt to him, and to keep in her memory an eternal acknowledgment! For <hi>Andronico</hi> was not content to employ his tongue in the defence of her honour in all companies, but vowed he would expoſe his life a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times for her protection. She muſt have been inſenſible to have neglected ſo many obligations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philippin</hi> purſues ſtill his firſt point, to be diſengaged in marriage from <hi>Eliſe;</hi> perſevering in his ordinary mockeries, and calling <hi>Andronico</hi> his Rival, (for ſo he had been, when he firſt knew <hi>Eliſe,</hi> being then a Maid) and wondring he ſhould contradict him in this ſeparation, which he eſteemed ought to have been ſought by <hi>Andronico,</hi> if he had any deſign to marry her. Thus into what ſtrange ſpeeches was he not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported! ſaying, he ſhould but be too happy being refuſed; and was very glad to yield him a good, as he was ſorry to take from him: And full of many other nipping taunts, which I will leave to the conjecture of a good judgment, rather then to ſoil the whiteneſs of theſe pages.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all theſe ſmall riots there was great hatred, and almoſt all the Town took part with the one or the other ſide. Thoſe which held with <hi>Philippin,</hi> trumpeted every where the violence <hi>Timoleon</hi> had uſed on his will to make him yield to this marriage: And <hi>Scevole</hi> being rich, wanted not envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which rejoyced to ſee theſe troubles in his family. But this party was leaſt: For the inſupportable inſolence and pride of <hi>Philippin,</hi> in his words and actions, made him odious to thoſe which had no intereſt in his cauſe. So that juſtice and vertue fighting for <hi>Eliſe,</hi> made the ſide of <hi>Andronico</hi> much more ſtrong and puiſſant. His modeſty and diſcretion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to the good will that was borne him by many: There was not any that eſteemed not <hi>Eliſe</hi> to have been happier being his, then <hi>Philippin's;</hi> for contentment having been preferred before wealth and riches, it is not to be doubted ſhe ſhould have enjoyed as much in the company
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98576:49"/>
of this mean Gentleman, as this great Lord, which uſes her with ſo much cruelty and diſdain.</p>
               <p>As things were in this eſtate, there happens to be a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age not far from <hi>Philippins</hi> lodging, which are common friends to both our Oppoſites. They are both invited to the feaſt; but beſought with all affection not to quarrel there, for not hindring a Company that was aſſembled to be only merry and make good cheer. Which they both ſolemnly promiſe to thoſe that invite them, in ſo free a planner, that their inviters hoped I know not what of reconcilation. But here is a ſtrange web made. For you ſhall know that <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> weary to live ſo long, without ſeeing the iſſue of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters proceſs; and not able to ſupport ſeeing himſelf the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proverb and object to all his neighbours, by a ſecret ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the devil (as it's to to be believed) lets himſelf be led by the ſpirit of vengeance, eſteeming <hi>Philippin</hi> dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand with his adverſary, to abuſe his patience and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his daughter, holding his reputation in ſuſpence during the length of this purſuit. He could not come to his ends of <hi>Philippin</hi> at <hi>Bellerive,</hi> nor at <hi>Gold-mount,</hi> becauſe in the Country he always went ſo well accompanied in time of his defiance, that he had no means to approach him. He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, that walking the ſtreets without ſuſpect, it would be eaſie to ſurpriſe him, and take the life of him that had made him loſe his honour, ſtealing it traiterouſly as he had raviſhed and ſtole his daughter.</p>
               <p>Ill deſigns are as ſoon taken as thought on, and pernicious counſels as ſoon followed as propoſed. For at firſt diſcovery he made to his ſon <hi>Herman,</hi> he offers to execute this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; and <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> himſelf would be of the party; but <hi>Herman</hi> conjures him to keep his houſe for the conſervation of his goods, to the end that if it ſhould come to be diſcovered after the blow, he might (having paſſed the Alps, or croſſed the ſeas) be aſſiſted by his meanes in <hi>Italy</hi> or in <hi>Spain, Pyrrhe,</hi> though with much pain yields to this advice to: And having, acquainted an antient Servant whom, they truſted, ſtout of his hands, whom we will call <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing to paſs their vengeance. Whilſt <hi>Philippin</hi> and <hi>Andronico</hi> are in feaſting, dancing, mirth and joy, with pleaſant jeſts and gallantries, their looks are always at'on'ſide, not ſpeaking but with eyes whoſe ſparkles in ſtead of love threaten death; yet do they contain themſelves, to maintain their promiſe. Not but that they ſaid what they pleaſed; for in thoſe corners ſeparated it was impoſſible to joyn, not holding themſelves to have power to ſpeak without being moved, and once moved, to ſtrike; it was very hard to diſcourſe, and not betray their paſſions.</p>
               <p>Here are wars made at <hi>Philippin</hi> upon the ſubject of his Amazon: but he raiſes her merits with ſuch art, as his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence blinds the judgments of all thoſe that hear him; and thoſe who accuſed him in the beginning, excuſe him in the end. At another corner, <hi>Andronico</hi> being perſecuted in jeſt and ſport as <hi>Eliſe's</hi> Knight; what ſays he not in the praiſe of this vertuous woman? And that he ſays in honour of her, could not but turn to the diſadvantage of him that uſed her with ſo much in juſtice. And as he was founded in a truth, he he ſuſtains it with ſo good terms, that there was not any of thoſe which heard him that had not their eyes fixed on his good faſhion, and ears on his tongue. Many times he unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately happened to ſay, That if <hi>Philippin</hi> were dead, which might ſhortly be expected by the juſtice of heaven, he would eſteem himſelf much honoured to marry <hi>Eliſe,</hi> as widow to a Knight, and one of the honeſteſt women on earth. But <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> could not ſay ſo much: For if <hi>Philippin</hi> lived, ſhe was diſhonored; He being dead, ſhe durſt not appear in the eyes of the world.</p>
               <p>From thence his paſſion carried him to ſay, that <hi>Eliſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved better fortune then <hi>Philippin;</hi> who (in truth) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expreſs commandment of her parents would never have married him. And after this falls to other particularities, which had not fallen to the ground, though they had not been gathered up by the ears of <hi>Philippin.</hi> Many times thoſe which heard them ſpeak ſo diſgracefully one of the other, would fain have broken off this diſcourſe: But as there is nothing that tickles the ears more then detraction, by a natural malice which inclines us to ill, all give way to their diſcourſe. And that which at laſt loſt <hi>Andronico,</hi> was a word that ſlipt from him unawares, as reproaching <hi>Philippin</hi> of the aſſaſſination
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98576:50"/>
of <hi>Valfran,</hi> although he were innocent by the oath of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. It might have been eaſie, and it may be permitted (ſays he) by the courſe of the world, to return a treaſon by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but I hate too much ſuch baſe unworthineſs. <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico,</hi> this will coſt you very dear.</p>
               <p>It is now time to conduct the new married pair to bed; where being arrived, all this fair company are ſeparated. In the great number of Caroches and horſes which waited at the gates, it was eaſie for <hi>Herman</hi> and <hi>Roboald</hi> to ſtand in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night amongſt this preſs; from the midſt of which comes <hi>Philippin</hi> ſlightly accompanied, and on foot, by reaſon of the neerneſs of his lodging. As he drew neer <hi>Roboald,</hi> who ſtroke down the Page that carried the torch, <hi>Herman</hi> on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back comes upon <hi>Philippin</hi> like thunder, preſenting the mouth of his piſtol to his forehead with a ſteel-bullet, which ſtrikes out his brains on the ſtones. <hi>Philippin</hi> ſeeing him come, believed it was <hi>Andronico;</hi> and cryed, O Traitor! O <hi>Eliſe!</hi> thou mak'ſt me be murdered! And ſo dyed. After this blow, <hi>Herman</hi> and <hi>Roboald</hi> retire by favour of the night to their lodgings, from whence they went next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by break of day; arriving at <hi>Vaupre</hi> with an aſſurance as if they had done nothing, for they were certain not to have been perceived.</p>
               <p>But let's return to the City, where in an inſtant all was in rumor and alarm: Many fled; others more valiant, went to behold this tragick ſpectacle of <hi>Philippin</hi> ſpread ſtark dead on the pavement. <hi>Andronico,</hi> who was no way guilty, comes on horſ-back with others. He laments, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did <hi>Pompey,</hi> the death of his enemy; nevertheleſs with a certain faſhion min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with joy, which gives an entrance to ſuſpiſion if it were not himſelf, that after ſo deteſtable a deed comes to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the innocent. Many circumſtances ſeem to accuſe him; as the diſcourſe he had held in the Wedding-hall, and 'twas a man on horſ-back that kill'd <hi>Philippin.</hi> Many ſaid aloud, that if he did it not, he had made it to be done; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with as much conſtancie, as truth. There were other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of ſome that had ſeen him take horſe at the very time that <hi>Philippin</hi> was ſhot, giving aſſurance that he could not have committed an action ſo baſe; but that he was of the plot there was place for ſuſpition, leaving all theſe groundleſs reports. He raiſing his head, ſtrengthened with his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98576:51"/>
retires confidently to his houſe, believing already to be in poſſeſſion of his <hi>Eliſe.</hi> Who had no ſooner underſtood the bloody murder of her husband, with this miſerable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Andronico's</hi> being ſuſpected; but changing the love ſhe had for <hi>Philippin</hi> into pitty, and the good will ſo worthy which ſhe had born <hi>Andronico</hi> into a mortal hatred, ſhe takes this conjecture for a truth, and upon this firſt impreſſion no way doubts it; whether it was to have her in poſſeſſion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the promiſe ſhe had given him, or to be revenged for the attempt of <hi>Valfran,</hi> he had done this baſe act himſelf, or made it be done. And even as that friendſhip which is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on vertue, ſwouns before its contrary; the ſame doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the ſoul, encountring vice; like the ſtone called <hi>Praſſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> that loſes its luſtre at the approach of any poyſon. Here is ſhe for the loſs of <hi>Philippin</hi> filled with grief not to be comforted; her affection is redoubled by this cruel and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous treſpaſs; and ſo void of good will for <hi>Andronico,</hi> that ſhe hath his name in horror, and the thought of him is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination inſupportable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philippin</hi> is conveyed to <hi>Bellerive</hi> to the ſepulchre of his fathers, whither couragious <hi>Eliſe</hi> had the ſtrength to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him. Her mourning and tears, as ſincere as her love was true, moved more pitty in thoſe that ſaw her thus living, then for her dead husband. For all ſaw by the miſgovernment of this young Lord a juſt puniſhment from heaven; the hand of God lay heavy on his head that had been daſhed in peeces: according to that word of <hi>David,</hi> A perfidious man given to fleſh and blood, never ſees the days of half the courſe his life. <hi>Scevole,</hi> a man of great underſtanding, accompanies his daughter, as Dowager to the houſe of <hi>Philippin,</hi> to theſe fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rights; with his Grandchild <hi>Dalimene,</hi> as ſhe that was now univerſal heir by the declaration of the validity of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Eliſe</hi> and <hi>Philippin,</hi> whoſe rightfull ſucceſsion none could withſtand.</p>
               <p>But this is not all in queſtion to diſlodge the <hi>Amazon</hi> out of <hi>Goldmount.</hi> For, not to ſpeak of the complaints of this deſperate Lover, and the furies that ſeiſed her at the receit of the news of his death, then when ſhe hoped to have come to Town to have married him; who being the corrupter of her integrity, ought to be the repairer of her renown. There wanted not much, being filled with a rage full of blindneſs,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98576:51"/>
that ſhe had not killed two miſerable children which ſhe had by <hi>Philippin</hi> the time they had been together; and for to have kept them company, have pierced herſelf with the ſame blade that had murdered them. But the inſpiration of her good Angel was ſtronger in this aſſault then the ſuggeſtion of the ill; who raiſes for a time the impious above the cedars of Libanus, for to throw them in the end into the deep pit of deſpair. At length ſhe reſolves on an enterpriſe as fooliſh as hardy; (but on what doth one not think in extremities?) which was, To make herſelf Miſtreſs of the Caſtle of <hi>Gold-mount,</hi> and to keep it by force of arms, to which her courage and ordinary exerciſes had incited her. For to return to her father was a thing ſhe could not hear of, doubting the ill uſage and indignation of <hi>Pyrrhe,</hi> and after ſo much greatneſs and magnificences that ſhe had taſted in the houſe of <hi>Philippin;</hi> could not reduce herſelf to the poverty of the paternal, that ſhe knew for the ſubject of her ill life was become altogether incommodate.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Scevole</hi> having had the wind of this deſign, goes ſtrait to <hi>Gold-mount;</hi> and authoriſed by the Juſtice of the Country, aſſembles by the Provoſt all the Commons, and begirts this Warrior in her Caſtle; who having made more proviſion of men then victuals, was delivered by thoſe that ought to have defended her, into the hands of <hi>Scevole,</hi> who was pleaſed to remit her into thoſe of her fathers, that fains to be ignorant of the death of <hi>Philippin;</hi> he receives her alone, refuſing to meddle with her children, which <hi>Scevole</hi> takes charge of as deſcended of his ſon-in-law, though illegitimate. When <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> ſaw herſelf in <hi>Vaupre</hi> ſhut up in a dark priſon, it was then ſhe had occaſion to curſe her faults paſſed, and to acknowledg that theſe tribulations were the leaſt that ſhe deſerved. VVe will leave her to ſuffer under the hardneſs of her irons, and ſuch barbarous uſage that I abhor to write of, to come to <hi>Scevole,</hi> who returns to the City triumphing in the execution of this juſtice mingled with ſo much mercy, for he might have uſed a more exemplary puniſhment on this criminal rebellion. He again confirms the marriage of <hi>Eliſe</hi> with <hi>Philippin,</hi> and anew declares <hi>Dalimene</hi> heir, and her Mother dowager and governeſs. <hi>Eliſe</hi> ſhews in her face the ſigns a widowhood full of grief and bitterneſs; her voice is like the turtles, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſolitude is pleaſing to her.</p>

And deſirous, preſſed by his own affections, to give her ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; as he thought to have drawn her aſide, ſhe prevents his deſign by her ſudden retiring, which gave him no means of ſpeech but before <hi>Sophie,</hi> his diſcourſe being no other but that is accuſtomed in the like occaſions. But at laſt <hi>Sophie</hi> being called into another place, left <hi>Eliſe</hi> (as formerly) in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of <hi>Andronico.</hi> But ſhe turning her back to him, as if ſhe had ſeen a ſerpent or fearfull dragon, follows her mother, and leaves him not only as an indifferent perſon, but as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted; which was greater in the heart of <hi>Andronico</hi> then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpittle or ſhame; for ſuch an outrage in the lightning of her eyes threatned a horrible tempeſt.</p>
               <p>The troubleſom confuſion to ſee himſelf left, now when he thought to be moſt favourably received of this woman, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given her ſo many teſtimonies of his love, and honoured her ſo reſpectfully; puts more colours in her face then we ſee in the Rainbow that proclaims a ſtorm. And truly, being this man is innocent, let it be permitted us to ſay this word in his defence: O <hi>Eliſe,</hi> you will have time to repent you, to have condemned one before hearing him, and to have ſo ſoon given belief to a light conjecture. There is nothing ordinarily more falſe then the reports of the Town; for fame increaſes not but for the moſt part with lyes; the divers reports and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are but dreams of men waking. You will ruine your own happineſs; and for a ſlight diſdain you make this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heart feel, it will coſt you your life; you wrong your ſelf more then him, and lay a foundation of diſlike which will be your common loſs. Who is not aſtoniſhed at your incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie? to ſee her which in her greateſt adverſities ſhewed more ſtrength then a man, for a vain ſhadow ſhew weaker then a woman; like a Roſe-tree that bends with the ſmalleſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98576:52"/>
wind? who can juſtifie your ingratitude, or uphold your forgetfulneſs, in but thinking of the good offices this young Gentleman did you, when expoſing himſelf to ſo many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and hazards to maintain your honour, and the validity of your marriage, againſt himſelf and his own contentment? You permitted him to love you, when there was no hope to ſee the fruits of the flowers of his affections; and now that the day of hope begins to appear, you cover him with a night of deſpair, not only forbidding him to love or ſeek you (the lawfull gate being open) but alſo to ſee or ſpeak to you. As great a heart as a woman ſhews in the moſt fearfull accidents, ſhe returns always to her own nature, and many times in the ſmalleſt encounters makes known her great weakneſs; like the captive King that wept not ſeeing his ſon ſlain, and yet ſhed tears at the death of his ſlave. I have much ado, <hi>Eliſe,</hi> that I accuſe you not of lightneſs, and eſteem you worthy of the pains you go to ſuffer, forgetting the grief I felt in reciting what you have ſuffered. For is it not like the Prince of Iſrael; to hate ſo unworthily thoſe that love you, and love unjuſtly thoſe that hate you? I ſee you are like the ſick, that have their taſte ſo changed, that thoſe meats they held delicate being well, go againſt their ſtomacks in their indiſpoſition: For this ſincere affection which you have had to this Gentleman, is converted into hatred. This change cannot but be extreme, the effect being ordinarily compared to its cauſe. She is like the fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Andronico</hi> retires by this blow, with a thouſand divers thoughts that troubled his very ſoul. Not able to reſt all night, being ſo afflicted with different paſſions, he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſearch in himſelf, and plunge into the ſecret corners of his ſoul, to find in what he had failed in duty to his Love, to be uſed in this ſort: And after having turned often in this labyrinth, from whence he ſtill came forth by the gate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, thought it was for the ſmall aſſiſtance he had given to <hi>Scevole</hi> and <hi>Eliſe</hi> in their journey to <hi>Bellerive</hi> and <hi>Gold-mount,</hi> where he thought he ſhould have teſtified the fidelity of his courage. Sometime he was perſwaded, that <hi>Eliſe</hi> much grieved, conſolation diſpleaſed her; being there is nothing that diſpleaſes more in tears then muſick, though in it ſelf
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98576:53"/>
moſt pleaſing: But to think that ſhe grieved for the death of a man that had ſo wronged her during his life, and of whom ſhe had complained a thouſand times to himſelf; it was a thing he could dot admit into his belief.</p>
               <p>VVhat ſhall he do amongſt theſe perplexities? He writes; but his Letters heretofore ſo well received, are rejected with a faſhion that teſtified a diſcontentment, and no ſmall one. This affront ſeems very ſenſible to his honour: Many times deſpight counſels him to raſe it, as not to the purpoſe to ſuffer this indignity, if he were to live with her, as he deſires and hopes. He hopes it; for his love, of more ſtrength then this outrage, makes him wave all theſe punctual conſiderations: He deſires it, becauſe this Match will be extremely advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him. And eſteeming it ſure, being founded on her ſtrong promiſes; not able to reſiſt the fierce aſſaults of his paſſion, nor the diſdain received, nor to forget his purſuit, or reſolve on patience,(that ſo ſoveraign herb in all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of our thoughts) he is reſolved, on what price ſoever, to accoſt <hi>Eliſe,</hi> with opportunity, or by importunity. For to live longer in this incertitude of the cauſe of his diſgrace, is impoſſible; and impoſſible it was for him to find the occaſion; for what prayers ſoever he make, this favour is denied him, without other reaſon but a furious indignation. He prevails ſo much with <hi>Sophie</hi> to whom he addreſſes himſelf, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains permiſſion to ſpeak with <hi>Eliſe,</hi> but in her preſence; yet nevertheleſs apart, and in that faſhion, as ſhe might not heat any thing of importance which he had to communicate to her. <hi>Sophie</hi> according to her promiſe commands <hi>Eliſe</hi> to hear <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronico;</hi> wondring much from whence this ſudden change ſhould proceed towards this Gentleman, that had given her ſo many teſtimonies of his love, and done her thoſe obliging ſervices, the converſation of whom had heretofore been ſo pleaſing to her. For although this ſoul report came to her ears of the ſuſpition for the death of <hi>Philippin,</hi> nevertheleſs ſhe was a woman ſo wiſe and ſo adviſed, that without heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to theſe Town-reports, ſhe choſe rather to believe her eyes, which made her ſee many vertues in this honeſt man, then to incline too lightly to a flying murmur that entred her ears.

                  </gap>iots that ingender ordinarily between thoſe that love deareſt. <hi>Eliſe</hi> beſought her not to preſs any further on that ſubject, which was dangerous, and would draw blood of the noſe of her child with often blowing. Yet nevertheleſs as ſhe was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſubmiſſive, putting her will under the obedience of the commandment of her mother, ſhe conſents to this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but being in preſence one of the other, their contrary paſsions were ſo vehement, that the words they had purpoſed to ſay, die in the utterance, reſting a long ſpace without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring one word; An evident ſign of the troubles of their thoughts. But oh how different were they! For <hi>Eliſe's</hi> were of hatred and diſdain, and thoſe of <hi>Andronico</hi> of love and grief. 'Tis true, a mean grief may be told; but an extreme, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the underſtanding, ſurmounts the power to expreſs it. At laſt, as the fear of the death of <hi>Craeſus</hi> untied the tongue of his ſon being born dumb; even ſo the fear to loſe this fair occaſion that he had purchaſed with ſo much pain, drew from the mouth of <hi>Andronico,</hi> rather dead then living, theſe words drawn from the eſſence of the ſame diſpleaſure:</p>
               <p>Madam, My grief is ſuch, that if it would but give me the means to preſent it, I ſhould diminiſh the infinity of it, as I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in terms that will rather offend the greatneſs; then any way decipher the leaſt part thereof; it would be too weak, if it gave not leave to the ſighing of my complaint. All that comforts me in this mortal diſtreſs, is, that I ſuffer for your occaſion; ſo that the excellencie of the cauſe eaſes the rigor of the effect: For it is ſo much honour for me to ſuffer for you, that for ſo worthy a ſubject, there is no ſort of torment, which, in ſtead of offence, is not held by me for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</p>
               <p>At theſe doubtfull words, <hi>Eliſe</hi> ſuddenly judged he was guilty of the death of her husband; but the biting of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience made him fearfull, and therefore ſtrove to cover it with theſe artificious words; ſearching excuſes to make him, if not pardonable, leſs odious. Which made her return him this ſharp anſwer: Content yourſelf with my ſilence, <hi>Andronico,</hi> and convert not my patience into fury, for fear my forbearing lightens not from the juſt feeling of my wrong. Content you to have reduced me, by your execrable vileneſs, to the higheſt period of grief that a ſoul can feel, that loſes the half of herſelf in the loſs of her husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:98576:54"/>Madam, replied <hi>Andronico,</hi> I eaſily pardon the grief your good nature feels for the death of him, to whom the law of marriage had tyed you in a ſtrait bond; for I know how ſtrongly you loved him, notwithſtanding the ill uſage by which he violated your conſtancie: but I cannot conceive what grief ſhould make you call me vile and execrable; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents ſo far different from ſo many other ſweet names that I have heretofore ſeen you chooſe to favour me; titles ſo far from thoſe that your courteſie not long ſince did oblige, not my deſert, but my fidelity; that I am forced to tell you, that as the bee which makes the hony, is that which ſtings the moſt ſenſibly; and as hony ſo ſweet in the mouth, is moſt ſharp to wounds; and as there is nothing more ſcalding then oil, when it is hot; ſo theſe outrages coming from your mouth are ſo much more grievous, by how much I have received conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gratification. Muſt I be ſo unhappy to ſee the fire of my wounds come from the place from whence I expected my healing? Is it poſſible after ſuch a metamorphoſis, that you retain the name of that <hi>Eliſe</hi> that profeſſed ſo much love to me then, when it was leſs lawfull to love me? of that <hi>Eliſe</hi> which I ſo devoutly honoured, and againſt all theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions I cheriſh yet more then my proper life? I cannot tell more how to name you, nor know not what term to find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing enough in any idiom, that can ſet forth as it ought ſuch an inconſtancie.

This is the ſmalleſt favour I may hope of you, ſeeing I can draw ſo much from cruelty it ſelf; there is nothing more juſt then to make known to an offender the cauſe of his ſuffering, nor any thing more unjuſt then to conceal it from him.</p>
               <p>If a ſmall cloud can take from our eyes the ſight of the ſun that is ſo great, replied <hi>Eliſe,</hi> it is eaſie with a ſmall fault to ſhadow out one of a greater importance. But that God that ſees all, and which knows the ſecrets of hearts, and dives into the dark corners of our reins, that is ſerved with things of ſmaller appearance to make known the moſt covered, and which can draw the light of the truth from midſt of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obſcurities of falſhoods; will alſo be ſerved with my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the conſideration of that love which I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore

               <p>In all this there was much ſaid, yet nothing of what ſhould have been ſaid: And what is he that would not wonder at theſe delays, and at the length of theſe circumlocutions? For ſince Paſſion is a labyrinth, it is no marvel if it have many turnings. <hi>Andronico</hi> having had ſome feeling of the reports which ran to his diſadvantage upon the death of <hi>Philippin,</hi> doubts it might be about this accuſation; comforts himſelf in the hope to ſee an end of this Mine, that threatned a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent after it had taken wing; being founded on the truth of his innocence. So that for fear to anger this woman, knowing there is nothing more fierce then a Bee when it is moved, which puts her life in the wound ſhe makes, and never ſtings that ſhe reſts not wounded to death, he fains to be ignorant of the end of this her fury, in ſaying to her, That when one endures a pain deſerved, it is made ſo much the more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; that one believes to extinguiſh a ſin, is to ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſert; it would be hard, but more inſupportable to ſuffer innocently, and again in being ignorant of the cauſe of his ſufferance. And then kneeling down at the feet of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> with a voice ſomthing higher then before, or then the place where he was, and the preſence of <hi>Sophie,</hi> although not neer, ſeemed to permit him. Madam, ſays he, I will die here, or learn from your mouth what can be the cauſe that puts me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo fierce a diſgrace; nor will I ever leave you till you give me this ſatisfaction, to let me know of what death I ſhall die; for I take heaven to witneſs, I find not my ſelf guilty of any thing that may be prejudicial to you. I beſeech you not to give way to calumnies and reports, to the prejudice of my ſincerity.</p>

Madam, replied the unfortunate <hi>Andronico,</hi> this is not to give me light, but to plunge me into a new obſcurity: I beſeech you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe riddles, and not to tell me again in other terms the ſame thing you have already told me; for what can he fear, that doubts not death? but on the contrary, if I loſe your favour, I deſire it to free me of a life which will be more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom then it, being deprived of your love. All that aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes me, is your honour, which you ſay is engaged to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and in that it may be you have ſaid better then you think: For when the purity of my intentions ſhall be known, the greatneſs of my affections, the ſincerity of my ſoul, and how many dangers I have run to give you proof of my ſervice, and that you have recompenced me with deſpair that will take my life; it will be hard for you to remove this ſtain of ingratitude, which like an eternal infamy will remain on the pureneſs of your underſtanding. If ever it happen, not that I attempt, but only think any thing that might never ſo little prejudice your honour, for the conſervation whereof I'll ſpend a thouſand lives, I deſire that the heavens never pardon me any fault.

It will be eaſie for me to reſolve to die, after being deprived of that I held dearer then life. What do I ſay? Truly it will be harder to me to reſolve to live, or rather to outlive ſuch a loſs; yet to loſe my life without knowing the cauſe for which I die, this is that I cannot reſolve on, if I do not bury my ſelf with the quality of the maddeſt of all humane creatures.

Wherefore I intreat you to permit me to preſs you with all ſort of importunity, to declare to me the ground of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; otherwiſe I ſhall believe that the words you have given me, and thoſe promiſes you have made me, even by writing, as I can eaſily teſtifie, proceeded not but from a changeable humour, incident to your f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At this <hi>Eliſe</hi> was touched to the quick, and (as they ſay) in the ball of the eye: Who cutting off ſuddenly this long diſcourſe, all inflamed with ſpight, and red with choler, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers him, VVhat do you upbraid me with my words, and taxe me with promiſes, to draw me into your crime, and to match with the murderer of my husband God will not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my diſloyalty, although thy falſhood. Go traitor! and the moſt ſoiled with infidelity that earth ever bore! Doeſt thou in this ſort wrong my eaſie belief and ſimplicity, to make me guilty, although innocent of the bloody falſhood that you wrought in your thoughts? Go crocodile, that weeps before me to devoure me, and to raviſh mine honour with my life. It was not on the miſeries that I ſuffered then, that thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributedſt thy tears, but on the ill fortunes thou prepareſt for me. Oh, I will never truſt on the faith and words of any man; or let heaven puniſh me with all griefs that are to be imagined, if it happen to me again to let my ſelf be cozened.</p>
               <p>At theſe words, uttered in a faſhion that teſtified that the exceſs of indignation had made her beſide herſelf, <hi>Andronico</hi> knew cleerly the truth of her diſtaſte. Of which much joyfull in himſelf, because the teſtimony of his conſcience made him unblameable; in ſtead of excuſing this invective with ſharp words, being wronged, ſmiling as it were, and ſweetly blotting out this error which ſeemed pleaſing; well, Madam, replied he, if I ſhould have committed this crime of which you accuſe me, what had I done but rendred <hi>Philippin</hi> that he would have given me by the attempt of <hi>Valfran?</hi> But I have not ſo baſe a courage to give ſuch commiſſion to others, nor ſo trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous to execute them my ſelf. I often deſired to ſee him with his ſword in his hand, without other advantage but my courage, and the juſtice of your cauſe; but we were hindred in this deſign by our friends. But when I ſhould have thrown
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98576:56"/>
him where his misfortune has caſt him, what had I done in it but the office of the divine juſtice, which vanquiſhed by his unworthineſs was forced to extermine him off the face of the earth, where he led ſo infamous and ſhamefull a life. And to you, Madam, what ſervice ſhould I have done you in breaking the bands of your ſlavery, and of the hardeſt tyrannie that was ever proved? But as I do quit the thanks you ſhould owe me, if I had done you that good office; ſo you ought not to accuſe me of a fact I have not committed, but (to confeſs to you ingeniouſly) many times thought. For why ſhould I not deſire the death of him that had conſpired againſt my life? and of him that in poſſeſſing of you, raviſhed me barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly of the deareſt pretenſion I had in the world?</p>
               <p>By theſe words <hi>Eliſe</hi> believes aſſuredly <hi>Andronico</hi> had at leaſt cauſed this murder to be committed; which made her thunder in theſe words full of fury and indignation; Ah diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But know, cruel, that although <hi>Philippin</hi> was ſevere to me, he never had a ſoul ſo baſe and traiterous as thou. But this ſhall not reſt ſo: for in the place where thou wouldſt offer mine honour to thy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thy own life ſhall be offered.</p>
               <p>She uttered this diſcourſe ſo loud, as ſhe made <hi>Sophie</hi> run to her; for with it ſhe cried out, as if <hi>Andronico</hi> had preſſed her with ſome unjuſt matter. To whom ſhe ſaid, Look you, dear mother, to what you have reduced me by your command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to entertain the murderer of my husband! Should you have tormented me ſo much, to make me hearken to this Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; who not ſatisfied with the blood of <hi>Philippin,</hi> will alſo by a certain art, as abominable as malicious, raviſh the honour of his poor wife! And judge if I had not reaſon to ſhun with all care this rock ſo dangerous: Not only he confeſſes his crime, but boaſts of it; and what is the end of his vileneſs, but only to intangle innocence in guilt with him? He thinks by the help of a certain Paper which his artificial importunities have torn from my ſimplicity, to make me conſenting to this

homicide: Of which if ever I thought, I deſire the juſtice of heaven nor of men may ever favour me.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Sophie</hi> were not amazed heading this language, I leave it to you to judge. And during the aſtoniſhment that ſeiſed her, <hi>Andronico</hi> had time to ſay to <hi>Eliſe,</hi> Madam, you have many other ways to be rid of my life, if you had but imployed that of your cruelty, without caſting alſo mine honour into the depth of ſhame, which is unſupportable to me; that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to break violently the laws of friendſhip, as barbarouſly as thoſe of courteſie. But I would have you know, that as I have loved you honourably and vertuouſly, theſe two props fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my love goes to ruine. I honour love when it hath vertue for its principle; but I love honour by a ſingular preferance it hath before life, and all things. Thoſe that touch mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, touch the ſight of mine eyes; for that was the only thing I could prefer to your love. But ſince that love will become ruinous to mine honour, I muſt proteſt I hold it for enmity, and mortal enmity; for never any of what quality or condition ſoever ſhall attempt on mine honour, whoſe life I will not take. Pardon me in loſing the duty I owe to love, being you are grown bankrupt of fidelity. And truly, if I ſay that it's falſe I confeſſed to be guilty of the murder of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin,</hi> of which I deteſt the author and the action as much as you can do with all the cunning of your ceremonious mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'tis certainly not for the loſs of that man that hated me, but that I have in abomination a murder ſo deteſtable. You might have contented you with your falſhood, and to have broken your oaths, and the writings of your promiſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking this odious pretext by which you conſpire the loſs of him that hath offered his blood for the ſuſtent of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. But as God lives in heaven that reveals the ſecrets of all hearts, and the ſeals moſt dark, I will turn theſe evils on your own head. And to the end you may know it was love, and not intereſt which made me ſeek you as long as I eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you vertuous; from henceforth renouncing the words you gave me, and writings I have of yours, I will make it appear in the face of Juſtice and of all the world, that I am innocent of the crime you would impoſe on me, and that you are guilty of the moſt noted perfidie that was ever acted.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ean while <hi>Eliſe</hi> tells her mother, this buſineſs is of that conſequence, as ſhe thinks it fit to make it known in the preſence of her father. They go to the chamber of <hi>Scevole;</hi> to whom <hi>Eliſe,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Sophie,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites all that had paſſed between her and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronico</hi> during the life of <hi>Philippin,</hi> the promiſes they had made both by word and writing; upon which ſhe lays a ſtrong conjecture, that <hi>Andronico</hi> had murdered her husband, which himſelf came to avow, but in ſuch doubtfull and covered terms, that although he did not expreſly confeſs the crime, nevertheleſs it was eaſie to judge he was conſenting: For her ſelf making thoſe promiſes, ſhe had never thought of other death to <hi>Philippin</hi> then natural, having never had any deſign againſt his life by any bloody means, nor poyſon. Wherefore ſhe beſought her father to help her in the purſuit ſhe intended againſt <hi>Andronico,</hi> being there was nothing more juſt for an honeſt wife, then to ſeek by juſtice revenge for the murder of her husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scevole</hi> was much ſurpriſed to underſtand all this; and as he was wiſe and judicious, judged this buſineſs was very doubtfull. He takes his daughter aſide, promiſing her all aſſiſtance; but conjured her not to imbark herſelf in ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a navigation, without a firm biſcot of innocence and patience; prays her to tell him freely, as to her father that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98576:58"/>
would hide her faults with his cloke, and ſave her life as by his own, if ſhe had never had any words with <hi>Andronico</hi> againſt the life of <hi>Philippin,</hi> for that the quarrels they had gave ſome ſhadowes thereof? <hi>Eliſe</hi> aſſures him that there had never been any; and if ſhe did not find herſelf entirely exempt of guilt, ſhe would not attempt ſo dangerous a deſign.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Scevole</hi> made her ſee her great indiſcretion in the promiſe ſhe had made in writing, during the life of <hi>Philippin;</hi> ſaying that it was the rock on which <hi>Andronico</hi> had made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; and although ſhe were innocent in effect, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the world would eſteem her the cauſe: So that if <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico</hi> had kill'd him with the ſword, ſhe had kill'd him with the pen, foraſmuch as it appeared ſhe had given the cauſe of the execution. So that one may ſing of her that which the moſt ingenious of Poets engraved on the tomb of the <hi>Eliſe</hi> of <hi>Carthage:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>By her own hand unfortunate <hi>Elize</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Expir'd, and fell a fatal ſacrifice;</l>
                     <l>Though there Aenaea's rigor did exceed,</l>
                     <l>And was th'occaſion of ſo dire a deed.</l>
                  </q>
I'll tell you, daughter, it is lawfull for a wife during her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to promiſe to Jeſus Chriſt to take him for husband, if ſhe outlive her husband. It was a councel that the antient <hi>Origen</hi> gives to married women, which make a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to imbrace piety; and 'twas that vow that the jealous <hi>Ter<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nllian</hi> deſired ſo earneſtly of his wife. But to promiſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to another man during the life of her firſt husband, it is an action not only forbidden by the laws, but which gives an evident conjecture of adultery and murder: And as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealer and the thief are ſubject to the ſame puniſhment, even ſo thoſe that in conſequence of the like promiſes give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to thoſe that ſeek them to execute ſo villanous a deed. Daughter, here is in this more difficulty then you think on; and though your innocence be juſtified by juſtice, your honor will always reſt with ſome flaws in the opinion of men, and eſpecially by thoſe that are jealous to ſee wealth and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in our houſe, who will eſteem that my credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath rather ſaved you then your innocence. If you will
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98576:58"/>
take my counſel, I would have you hold on the defenſive, without undertaking to accuſe <hi>Andronico,</hi> except you had ſtronger proofs; for God in time will bring to light the truth, not leaving unpuniſhed ſo vile a fault.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Eliſe</hi> replied; But (father) would one have a more evident proof then his own proper confeſſion? I am aſſured that if he were called in queſtion, his conſcience would conſtrain him to flie, and would make guilt appear to the day; for his denial before my mother is a great ſign of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>uſation, being there is nothing that one denies with ſo much ardor, as a fault one finds themſelves guilty of, ſeeing there is none will publickly open his own diſhonour: And is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the common report hath not made you know there are great ſuſpitions againſt <hi>Andronico,</hi> which will become cleer convictions by the leaſt examination of Juſtice? Daughter, replies <hi>Scevole,</hi> I am of the trade; and you muſt know that that which we think many times the moſt notable, grows ſo doubtfull by the proceedings, that it's like a ſpring cleer where it riſes, but becomes troubled and muddy in its courſe; many times innocence ſuffers for the guilty, and thoſe are loſt that maliciouſly plead to loſe another.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Eliſe,</hi> if thou hadſt received theſe paternal words as ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, thou ſhouldſt not then for thine own feminine wilfulneſs have been precipitated in the miſery whereinto thou goeſt to plunge thy ſelf, in anſwering him thus. Sir, I owe you my life, but I owe my ſelf the conſervation of mine honour. I am a widow, and enjoying my rights; it is not that I would take my ſelf from the ſubmiſſion I owe you, nor draw my ſelf from your obedience; but I humbly beſeech you to permit to my juſt grief, that in revenging the death of my husband, I make lye and give death to this Traitor; who not content to have deprived him of life, would alſo rend mine honour from me. I hope to make it appear that he is only guilty both of his death and my ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>She goes out from her father, and reſolves to accuſe Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico. But <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

This citation is told to <hi>Scevole,</hi> who goes quicker to work; for he cauſes <hi>Andronico</hi> to be caſt into the bottom of a priſon, acouſing him
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98576:59"/>
in the name of <hi>Eliſe</hi> for the murder of <hi>Philippin. Andronico</hi> hath kindred in the Town, as alſo in the body of the Juſtice, where <hi>Scevole</hi> holds a principal rank. They go as ſuddenly to viſit him in priſon: where he having proteſted to them his innocence, ſaying it was an artificial trick of <hi>Eliſe's</hi> to deny her promiſe by this falſe accuſation; Look you, ſays he, how ſhe cuts her throat with her own knife! For if I had done this act, which can never be proved nor found by me, it muſt be by her perſwaſions, and by the inſtigation of her promiſes. Upon this, the friends of <hi>Andronico</hi> preſent a requeſt againſt <hi>Eliſe,</hi> obtaining of the Juſtice that ſhe might be in priſon to juſtifie herſelf of the ſame crime. <hi>Scevole,</hi> who is confident of the innocence of his daughter, and the ſtrength of his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and being juſt and a man of conſcience; although he feels a contradiction in this action that appears not very honorable; nevertheleſs preſſed by <hi>Eliſe</hi> herſelf, who runs voluntarily to yield herſelf priſoner, ſo much ſhe is encouraged to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of <hi>Andronico,</hi> whoſe ruine ſhe holds aſſured, he contents to this impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Here are our Lovers enemies in ſeparated places, runing with the bridle on their necks to their loſs, by the way of a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hatred. <hi>Andronico</hi> ſees himſelf accuſed of a murder he never ſo much as thought; and purſued by her of whom he hoped the greateſt felicities of life: And <hi>Eliſe</hi> ſees herſelf accuſed as conſenting to this death, bye him that ſhe thought certainly had procured it. At laſt their innocence is ecclipſed in the ſhadow of theſe dark dungeons, where they learned to their coſt, that priſons are like quagmires, which one gets not out of ſo eaſily as they ſlip in. <hi>Andronico</hi> being examined, denies abſolutely to have done, or cauſed this murder. But having to do with ſo able a perſon as <hi>Scevole,</hi> who knew ſo exactly to gather all theſe particularities that might make him guilty, at laſt all the world ſeemed to conjure his death: For all the words, his threats, his quarrels with <hi>Philippin</hi> are examined; his frequenting the houſe of <hi>Scevole</hi> with <hi>Eliſe;</hi> this Promiſe, which ſhe acknowledges to have been forced from her ſimplicity; ſhewing reciprocally that of <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's</hi> which he had forced her to receive, ſigned with his blood, the preſage of his helliſh enterpriſe. And not to make here a procedure of a proceſs in law; all the circumſtances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtures of the time of the aſſaſſination of <hi>Philippin,</hi> with his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98576:59"/>
laſt words at his death, that ſeemed to accuſe <hi>Eliſe</hi> to have made him be killed by the hands of <hi>Andronico,</hi> whom he call'd t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rritor. All this makes him guilty in that ſort, that the Judges following that which was produced and proved, in the end the opinion of all being changed by the prod<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cing of this Promiſe of marriage, went all for death; there reſted nothing but to confront him with <hi>Eliſe.</hi> Now as there are many forms of contrary qualities in a cloud, that produce the thunder that breaks all to powder the places where it falls: Even ſo in this enterview, after a thouſand flaſhes of lightening, ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no more of love, but of hatred that fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w from their eyes; the thunder of their words was underſtood, that broke in a thouſand peeces both their reputations and lives. For <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico</hi> having heard, that after this confrontation he muſt loſe his head; carried by deſpair, reſolves to draw into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation her that accuſed him with ſo much injuſtice, and turning his antient affection into a mortal hatred, it reſolved to have for company in death, her that he could no more hope for in life.</p>
               <p>So that being in preſence one of the other, as <hi>Eliſe</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to him what he had ſaid to her at her fathers, where it ſeemed he accuſed himſelf in terms obſcure. It is true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Andronico,</hi> with a tone furious, and a look on one ſide, that I did deſire the death of <hi>Philippin,</hi> and I have ſought it; and it doth not anger me to have done it, ſo that it were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of honour that are obſerved amongſt Gentlemen. It diſpleaſes me, that being dead as he is, I am charged to have killed him thus; but if that were, it had not been but by thy perſwaſion, ungratefull <hi>Eliſe!</hi> For who knows not but it was for thee that I had quarrels with him; that it was to deliver thee from tyrannie, that I have expoſed my life to h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Eliſe</hi> finding herſelf innocent, laughs at this accuſation; but the judges told her there was rather occaſion to weep;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98576:60"/>
for the ſtrongeſt proof that was againſt <hi>Andronico,</hi> being founded on the promiſe that he had drawn from her to marry him after the death of <hi>Philippin,</hi> was not the ſame preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption as great againſt her, that had received from the hands of <hi>Andrinico</hi> a writing of the ſame effect ? They find theſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſo connext, that they cannot condemn nor abſolve the one without the other. <hi>Eliſe</hi> may weep and proteſt her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; <hi>Andronico</hi> hath ſtruck a ſtroke that will bring them both to death. As much as <hi>Scevole</hi> underſtands in this ſcience, he finds himſelf ſwallowed in this buſineſs; his credit nor his authority cannot ſtay this torrent, that will overwhelm the honour of his houſe. His prophecies prove true, to the great grief of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> who repents (although too late) to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the violence of her unjuſt anger before the wholſom counſel of her father.</p>
               <p>To end quickly this troubleſom paſſage, ſhe finds herſelf innocent to be condemned as an infamous adultereſs, and as a cruel murderer of her own husband, to loſe her head with <hi>Andronico,</hi> as complice of his diſhoneſty, and murder of <hi>Philippin.</hi> It is a ſoveraign decree, that excepts no appeal; being pronounced in the morning, 'tis executed at night; where theſe unfortunate Lovers ſerve for a tragick ſpectacle to all the Town. <hi>Scevole</hi> not able to drink of the bitterneſs of this chalice, nor ſupport the indignity of this affront, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf; his wife <hi>Sophie</hi> took ſuch grief to the heart, as in three days death lays her in her tomb. <hi>Eliſe</hi> abandoned of the world, hath no more recourſe but to heaven. She's now come into the high ſea of grief, where a tempeſt promiſes her an aſſured ſhipwrack. She hears her ſentence, which brought thunder with lightning; and ſtruck with an aſſault ſo little look'd for, and ſo ſuddenly her underſtanding, that ſhe ſwouns with the horror, and thought to have dyed for fear of death. Happy in her pittifull misfortunes, if this death had antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated her ſhame! Returning from this ſwoun, her face paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the colours of death, her eyes ſunk and heavy, her lips pale, and with a voice trembling and mingled with a thouſand ſighs, ſhe breathed forth her ſad complaints. Who hath done this impittiable duty, to recall my ſoul into this miſerable body, to make it retire by a ſecond ſeparation more hard and cruel then this firſt, as more ingenious and leſs infamous! Who hath raviſhed the peace I felt in this ſweet
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98576:60"/>
languiſhing, for to draw me an innocent offering to the war of a ſacrifice as bloody as unjuſt! O <hi>Eliſe,</hi> muſt thou be the ſcandal of thy blood, the diſhonour of anceſtors! What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thy pomps, thy greatneſs, and honours? O my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Philippin!</hi> was it not enough that I loſt thee, without ſeeing my ſelf not only accuſed as the cauſe of thy loſs, but condemned as guilty of thy death? Ha cruel <hi>Andronico!</hi> that the honeſt reſpects thou haſt heretofore offered me, are become now hurtfull; and that thy converſation heretofore ſo ſweet, is changed into cruel bitterneſs! O how dearly do I pay the intereſt of my ſimplicity and inconſideration! Ah barbarous, thou knoweſt well the contrary of thy accuſation: But thou waſt not ſatisfied with the life of the husband, if thou doſt not quench thy enraged thirſt with the blood of his wife. Yet if thou hadſt done to me as to my husband, thou mightſt make me loſe my life, without tearing mine honour from me, but thou muſt needs add this to the meaſure of thy inſatiable cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. Ah Judges! why can you not ſee into my innocence? One day, but it will be too late, the juſt heavens that ſee the outrage your injuſtice doth to me, breaking the vail of a falſe accuſation, will let you ſee it; and then you will render to my aſhes the honour that you now raviſh from me.</p>
               <p>We would purſue further the end of theſe complaints, yet more pitttifull then they can be imagined, if we did not fear to beget pitty in theſe dungeons where inflexible cruelty makes its eternal reſidence. The preſence of a <hi>Dominican,</hi> (for the religious of this order, as they are in great eſteem every where, ſo principally in this City where this ſad adventure hapned) tempering by his words the extreme grief of her who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains thus without comfort, brought her in ſmall time to acknowledge that this diſaſter was not hapned to her without ſome ſecret providence of God, which could not turn but to her greater good; ſo that ſhe did not take that on the left, which ſhould be on the right; nor ſeized not the brand there where it burned moſt. Good Father (quoth ſhe) it is not death that I fear; knowing that is the end of all humane mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries: On the contrary, I have deſired it heretofore with no leſs impatience againſt the outrages of my ill fortunes; and if the laws of God did not forbid to have recourſe to a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary treſpaſs; I ſhould have fled it it as to a ſafe port. But that this death makes me run a double infamy, crimes of which I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98576:61"/>
am accuſed, although I be exempt both of the one and the other ſtain. This is it that makes my griefs unconſolable, and hinders me to frame in my ſoul a good reſolution. And that which is hardeſt to me, is, that the ſhame of this ſtain reflects on ſo many perſons of quality to whom I have the honour to appertain in this place. For to ſpeak truth, the grief of the death of my body is nothing comparable with this bitterneſs that aſſails at once all my underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Madam, replied the religious man, If it be the cauſe that makes the martyr, and not the pain; if you are innocent of that that is impoſed on you, you ought not to fear the loſs of your honour, nor any ſhame; for he that draws light from darkneſs, knows well a time that his providence hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make known your juſtification to thoſe very ſame that have condemned you. The diſciples of an antient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher grieving to ſee him condemned innocently, Alas my friends, ſaid he, would you have me die guilty! That which you eſteem a high point of deſolation, ought to be according to my judgment the ſtrength of your conſolation. If you but caſt your eyes upon the Example of Chriſtians, the Saviour crucified, is there anything comparable to Innocence, that defies all the moſt mortal enemies to reprehend it with any fault? And can there be any grief equal to his ſuffering? What his adverſaries had procured to obſcure his glory, proves the height of his greatneſs; and the gibber of the Croſs before ſo ignominious, is now the moſt precious ornament of crowns and diadems. The judgment of men ſhould not trouble you; it is God that judges you, and them and their judgments too: They are ordinarily falſe in their ballances; but the time will come that the hidden ſecrets of the dark ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the thoughts of all hearts manifeſted; and then every one ſhall be praiſed or blamed according as they have truly deſerved. Mean while, Madam, imploy this little time that remains to you of life, not in inutile complaints for the cutting off your days, not in proteſting your innocence, nor in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt your ill fortune, nor in reprehending the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of your Judges that have condemned you according to their laws, that make the rule of their conſciences; ſince the Lord, before whoſe tribunal you are going to appear, will that we be at peace and accord with our enemies whilſt we are in the way of this life; otherwiſe he will not be pleaſed with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98576:61"/>
the ſacrifice you go to offer him of your heart and body. Take heed you harden not your heart to day, when you hear the voice of the heavenly Bridegroom that knocks at your ears by my tongue; for it is written, that thoſe that have their hearts hardned will make an ill end.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe was preferred with ſo much devotion by this good Friar, whom we give the name of <hi>Symphorian,</hi> that the courage of <hi>Eliſe</hi> ſtrengthened on the one part againſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of death and ignominie, was alſo ſweetned on the other towards <hi>Andronico,</hi> ready to pardon him her death, without conſidering that ſhe was more cauſe of the loſs of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans life, then he had been of hers. After having diſcharged her conſcience in the ears of this good Father, and proteſted before God and that tribunal of penitence, where it is a fault inexpiable to lye unto the Holy Ghoſt, that ſhe was not any way conſenting to the murder of <hi>Philippin;</hi> yet nevertheleſs adores the will of God, to whom ſhe ſubmitted herſelf with all her heart, as to the rule of all juſtice. She embraces the croſs of him, that would die on the tree diſhonorably for her ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The whilſt <hi>Eliſe</hi> is thus diſpoſing herſelf, <hi>Andronico</hi> is brought to the ſame point of reſignation and reconciliation by a venerable Prieſt, whom we will name <hi>Cyrille;</hi> who having ſeen that this Patient drew no other conſolation of his death, but the pleaſure to be revenged of his enemy; after having plucked from his heart this malicious humour, with which if he ſhould have dyed, it had endangered his loſs eternally. Why but, Father, do I ill to rejoyce to ſee that this unworthy <hi>Eliſe</hi> is fallen into the pit ſhe had prepared for me, and that herſelf is brought into the precipice where ſhe had plunged my innocence? To which this worthy Churchman anſwered, That it was the work of a good and true Chriſtian not to render evil for evil, but good for evil; by the example of him that being curſed, curſed not again; but being unjuſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, preſented his che<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For as the iron flies unto the loadſtone as ſoon as the garlick is removed; the preſence of the diamond is taken away, that gives it liberty to carry it ſelf to that ſtraw that draws it to it: Even ſo thoſe ſouls being delivered of the ſtinking garlick of hatred, and the hard diamond of obſtination, were eaſily drawn to theſe acts of humility; that without the aſſiſtance of grace, one might rather deſire, then have hoped this condeſcenſion; and to ſee their tears mingled, whoſe blood muſt ſhortly be mingled upon a ſhamefull ſcaffold. Here <hi>Eliſe</hi> confeſſed aloud, that ſhe had no other proof againſt <hi>Andronico</hi> for the death of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin,</hi> but the common report, and conjecture that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhe had given in writing had brought him to that attempt to enjoy her in marriage.

               <p>Some of the beholders eſteemed theſe excuſes as fained, as they were moſt true. And the Judges, thoſe inflexible Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthes, mocked at theſe denials out of ſeaſon: The irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſentence is pronounced by their mouths; they have given it according to their conſciences, and conformable to the law: Their ears are ſo accuſtomed to hear theſe excuſes of offenders, that they are to them as unneceſſary ſongs; for it is the cuſtom of men to ſay they are innocent, conſidering only their witneſſes, not their own conſciences. They imagine that this miſerable pair being reſolved to loſe their lives, intended to preſerve ſome vain ſhadow of honour, in ſaying they were innocent of ſo odious a crime; but that being on the ſcaffold at the laſt hour of their death, which is the rack of racks, they would then declare all to the diſcharge of thoſe that had judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned them.</p>

Madam, the ſharp cutting ſword that is to ſever my head from my body, and my body from my ſoul, will not be ſo ſenſible to me, as the feeling of the grief that hath laid you in your bed for the ſorrow of my loſs and ſhame: The compaſſion <hi>I</hi> have of your heart, is more incomparably grievous then the pains <hi>I</hi> am to ſuffer.

               <p>Time with an inſenſible courſe advanced with great paces the hour of execution of this <hi>Innocencie guilty.</hi> Our Lovers are brought to the place with as much joy and gladneſs, as if it had been to their wedding. When they appeared on the bloody Theatre, they were beheld with many eyes, yet very different: For many had compaſſion of their miſeries, by a natural feeling that touches the hardeſt hearts; Others had them in horror, not ſo much for their faults, (for to ſin is a thing humane) but becauſe they publiſhed ſo loud their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, this diſpleaſed them, like Bats to whom light is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing. Strange quality of confeſſion, that makes the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent guilty.! The reſiſtance that our Patients made in not avowing that which truly they had not committed, made them odious in the eyes of the malicious world, that eſteemed them ſo much the more guilty. Neither their youth, quality, blood, freedom and courage, nor the other teſtimonies of piety that they ſhewed in this action, was capable to draw any ſorrow from the ſpectators; but all gave bleſſings on the Juſtice that purged the world of ſuch plagues. The Confeſſors imploy their utmoſt endeavours to draw this thorn from their hearts, by their mouths; and uſed the moſt preſſing and earneſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they could from divine inſpiration. But how could that come from their mouths, that was not entred into their thoughts? They died praiſing God, that was pleaſed to draw them to him by ſo rough and hard a way. The whilſt the world enemy to heaven, and father of raſh judgments, curſes them, God bleſſes them in giving them an invincible courage,

and fearleſs in this inevitable danger. <hi>Eliſe</hi> pardons all the world; and asking a thouſand pardons of <hi>Andronico</hi> as cauſe of his ſuffering, her head flew off in uttering theſe words, <hi>Jeſus be with me, Lord Jeſus!</hi> And <hi>Andronico</hi> incontinently after, with theſe words that his Confeſſor put in his mouth, <hi>My God, I remit my ſpirit into thy hand.</hi>

               <p>The opinions upon this Execution were very different: The Judges themſelves, whilſt the world praiſed their equity, were not well ſatisfied in their ſouls, although their hearts felt nothing. So much force hath truth, that thoſe that ſee it not, are nevertheleſs conſtrained by a ſecret vertue to have a feeling of it. But as the Seed-corn thrown into the earth, that one would think ſhould rot, is nouriſhed, &amp; taking root raiſes his head loaden and crowned with fruit out of the earth; even ſo this innocence for ſome time hidden and loſt by death, having gotten the victory by ſuffering, ſhall appear like a Palm ſo much the more ſtrait and high, by how much it had been overcharged; it will come from the midſt of hot burning coals, as pure as gold from a fornace.</p>

The Town begins to be odious to him as a priſon, or rather the ſepulchre of his honour and glory. This ſolitude appears a paradiſe to him of ſweet repoſe; How late (ſaid he) have I known thee! The ſweetneſs of this tranquile life begins to flatter his thoughts, and to reſolve him to quit the inſeparable unquietneſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and buſineſſes; which are ſo annexed to great dignities, that it is not without reaſon they are called Charges ; under which lies many times the rack, and makes the ſtrongeſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuffer.

               <p>And this Maid being fallen from this high fate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity where ſhe had ſeen herſelf in the company of <hi>Philippin,</hi> and now reduced to a priſon, in which beſides the deprivation of liberty ſhe experimented exceſſive cruelty; not knowing where to find more patience to ſuſtain the force of ſo cruel a perſecution: I will not fill theſe leaves with the multitude of her complaints with which ſhe filled her dark cabbin, that leſs deaf to her complaints then the ears of her father, ſeemed to ſuffer at her pains by its eccho and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound. And I believe if <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> had heard them, he muſt have been of marble, or have had pitty to have produced in the world a creature ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unfortunate. But not content to ſtop his ears at her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous griefs, and to the proteſtations ſhe made to live better hereafter, and to give him as much cauſe to love her in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as ſhe had given him to hate her for her diſſolute life. Nor would he that his eyes ſhould ſee the pittifull eſtate ſhe was reduced to, for fear to have had ſome compaſſion on her.</p>
               <p>An hundred times he had murdered her with his own hands, if nature had not ſtrongly reſiſted againſt ſuch a crime, and if the force of blood had not withſtood ſo bloody a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. But he believed that this perpetual impriſonment, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98576:67"/>
the barbarous uſage he exerciſed on this miſerable Caitiff, would in a ſhort time deliver him of her, whoſe life was as odious, as her death deſired. And it may be God, who hates hearts that are hardned and unpittifull, already diſpleaſed with the murder of <hi>Philipin,</hi> throws on the heads of <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Herman</hi> a judgment without mercy, becauſe they had been without mercy. Although the Iſraelites among the Egyptians committed great ſins, and were carried to dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable idolatry, for which the yoke, of a cruel ſlavery fell on their heads; yet in the midſt of their wickedneſs calling on the mercy of God, his eternal goodneſs hears their cryes, and haſted to their deliverance. <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Manaſſe</hi> were evil Princes; but their prayers drawn from their hearts by the ſtrength of their tribulations, made incontinently their peace with God, which inclined their aid.</p>
               <p>It is true, that <hi>Iſabel</hi> cannot be excuſed in having ſtain'd the honour of her family by her ill carriage: But it may be that being converted to God in midſt of her fighs, he heard favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably her complaints, and reſolved to pluck her from this chain; to the end that being delivered from the hands of this tyrant, ſhe might give herſelf to his ſervice in the quality of a Nun, to ſerve in holineſs and juſtice at the foot of his Altars even to the laſt hour of her life. Now I deſire that we ſhould remark, admire, and adore this divine Conductor, who brings her to this end by marvellous turnings, and ſweetneſs incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable.</p>

Yet in the beginning he executes with fidelity the commandment of his maſter, which was, To ſhut her up ſtraitly, to feed her poorly; in brief, to exerciſe on her all kind of cruelties. But in the end the water of the tears of <hi>Iſabel</hi> purſue this heart of ſtone; and the Lover with the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98576:67"/>
beauties of her face draws this breaſt of iron to a yielding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion. Such ſtrength hath a pleaſing form, of which all the force is in the ſweetneſs, but as much loved as it is pleaſing. Beauty hath an aſcendant power, and invitable on the fierceſt courages; the moſt cruel Tygres may be tamed and made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar by an amirable converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabel,</hi> in the beginning of her impriſonment, by a high and arrogant humour, contributed much to the ill uſage that <hi>Roboald</hi> made her feel: For there is nothing more odious and leſs inſupportable to God and men, then pride and cruelty.</p>
               <p>But when experience, Miſtreſs of the leaſt adviſed, had taught her, that as a bird taken in a ſnare, the more it ſtrives, the more it faſtens the knot; and the more ſhe deſired to be free, the ſtricter ſhe was kept; and that her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite drew on her a more ſevere puniſhment; ſhe begins to change her battery, and to ſpin fine, and to ſow the skin of the Fox to that of the Lyon. Her vain threats had ſerved her to nothing; it may be her ſmiles, and the charms of her converſation would get her more advantage. Of an angry and diſdainfull, ſhe becomes plaintiff, and a ſuppliant: So that changing the faſhion of her carriage, ſhe makes tender by little and little this ſavage courage, that begins to uſe her with more ſweetneſs, from that to hearken to her, then to behold her. At laſt, as a Man that cannot be always a Wolf to another Man, but hath a ſecret advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in his humanity that perſwades him to mildneſs, lets himſelf be taken by the ears, and ſees his heart raviſhed by the eyes.</p>
               <p>For both pitty and beauty gave ſuch aſſaults into the thoughts of <hi>Roboald,</hi> that forgetting the faith he had ſworne to his Maſter, he eſteems it would be impiety to obey him any longer in ſo ſavage and unnatural a commiſſion, to the prejudice of ſo many graces that appeared in the face of this fair Priſoner. And certainly the advantages that affections of Love have of thoſe of Friendſhip, are ſuch, that thoſe that are touched with the one make more difficulty to prejudice the other; even till their faults ſeem not only pardonable, but commendable, and rather worthy of glory then of blame.</p>

that the deliverance of this Maid ſhould take away the empire he had of her body, although ſhe had a far greater on his heart. Nevertheleſs to give her ſome teſtimony of his good will, he makes her hope her delivery on what price ſoever, though with the loſs of his life.</p>
               <p>Already crafty <hi>Iſabel</hi> knew by the ſighs and eyes of this new Lover, that he was in the toils ſhe had pitched for him; he hath no pleaſure but in her converſation, nor no content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but when ſhe ſpeaks to him. But he ſpeaks not to her of love, nor of any thing near it; for he knew the high courage of this Dame, that beheld him always as a ſervant; and as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as ſhe was to his government, uſed him nevertheleſs as an imperious Miſtreſs: beſides, to caſt his eyes on the daughter of his Maſter, he cannot but expect puniſhment for ſo inſolent an attempt; and a diſgrace that will bring his fortune into a ruine irrepairable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabel,</hi> that knew by this change of his face, and the variety of his diſcourſe, the troubles of his heart and confuſions of his thoughts; although ſhe had in horror this preſumption, and hated the authority of this Jailer, (for it is natural to hate thoſe that tyranniſe over our liberty) yet her cunning made her ſeem ignorant of that ſhe was clearly certain of; and although ſhe lightens love in this heart, ſhe fains to ſee nothing but pitty: And demanding of him if he grieved not to ſee her reduced to ſo pittifull an eſtate? I would to God, Madam, (quoth he) that One had as much pitty of my paſſion, as I have of compaſſion!</p>
               <p>It was enough ſaid to an underſtanding ſo quick as that of <hi>Iſabels.</hi> Who knowing the greatneſs of this flame, and heat of this ſpark, and as much inflamed with deſpight to ſee how high the inſolence of this Fellow was mounted, and being troubled that he had given too evident a teſtimony of his love; ſhe mocks at this diſcourſe by a ſubtile quickneſs: How now (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Roboald!</hi> you are then taken with this furious paſſion that hath cauſed me ſo many misfortunes: Truly I will from henceforth promiſe not only ſome comfort in my miſeries, but alſo ſome excuſe for my errors, if you are touched with this ſickneſs that made me run ſo fooliſhly after the juſt promiſes of marriage, which only the death of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin</hi> hath annulled. For beſides the natural inclination I had to love him, his carriage being accompanied with ſo many
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98576:69"/>
graces, augmented by ſo long converſation that made ſo pleaſing his lawfull ſeeking me in marriage; what Maid had not been conquered by ſo many charms of greatnes and good faſhion, accompanied with an intended wedding? I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that my Father allows not ſomthing to the weakneſs of my ſex, and the ſtrength of my affection; ſeeing that in the beginning of this young Lords ſeeking me, he permitted me to love him, and to receive his ſervice; it was himſelf that brought me into the folds, from whence after it was not in my power to return my ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roboald</hi> approving theſe excuſes, accuſes afterwards the unreaſonable cruelty of his Maſter; and finding himſelf taken by the beak, without denial that he loved her, he tries to hide at leaſt the cauſe of his flame, although he had unwiſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the effect. This was to throw a little water on a great fire; and in flying, to make himſelf be followed; and to ſtir the curioſity of this Maid, by the proteſtation that he made to die, rather then to diſcover the object that held him in a trance. Crafty <hi>Iſabel,</hi> that had had leiſure enough in her priſon to conſult with her glaſs, to learn in this faithfull glaſs the force the fire of her eyes had; being much pleaſed to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Jailer, and to make his fire ſo much the more ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as it was covered with the aſhes of ſilence and modeſty; this proud Captive intended to melt the wings of this new <hi>Icarus,</hi> hiding under a fained apparence of ſweetneſs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefull diſdain, armed with indignation not to be matched againſt the inſolence of this fellow, that had dared to raiſe his eyes to her, prepares in deceiving him to draw herſelf out of priſon and ſlavery, and to leave him covered with ſcorn and ſhame. At one time her fierce and high heart was combated with two paſſions very different, of love and liberty, and of hatred to him that ſhould be the author: For it ſeems that the ſuccour ſhe thought to receive of this man to get out of this miſery, would be a kind of obligation to love him; and on the other ſide, ſhe could not endure to let her thoughts fix on a ſervile object. She loves almoſt as much to remain a ſlave of body, and free of this obligation, as to ſee herſelf at liberty, and tyed by the bonds of duty to a man ſhe hated in her very ſoul. So that if ſhe could have found any other means to draw her from miſery, ſhe would certainly have paſſed it, rather then to make herſelf beholding to <hi>Roboald.</hi> But neceſſity (that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98576:70"/>
ſavage and cruel miſtreſs) made her reſolve, after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted ſome time in herſelf, to take this occaſion by the lock, reſerving after the recovering of her liberty the puniſhment of this madneſs, even with the ſword, if there were occaſion, and to purge him by this means of his error and folly. And as ſhe was practiſed in the arts of love, knowing well how to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the perſon of a Maid that is eaſie to be won; <hi>Roboald</hi> imagines he may win her heart, and make himſelf (as well as <hi>Philippin</hi>) poſſeſſor of her body. He flatters her and ſpeaks of love, but in ſuch generall terms, that he left always place to ſome exception, and made as if he ſighed for an object abſent; but ſhe ſees well that it was her preſence that drew theſe ſighs from his breaſt.</p>
               <p>Here are two cunning Gameſters that play who ſhall be cozened. <hi>Roboald</hi> proteſts he would not entertain her with ſo ill diſcourſe as that of his affections, if they were not ſincere and legitimate: But it being the greateſt comfort one can have in their ſorrows, to communicate them to a faithfull friend; and he thinking ſhe had felt for <hi>Philippin</hi> all the ſtings that this paſſion is accuſtomed to incite in their hearts that receive it.
<q>
                     <l>Thy counſel can aſſwage my ſwelling grief,</l>
                     <l>And to my ſufferings give me ſome relief.</l>

               <p>It is true, replied <hi>Iſabel,</hi> that I might give ſome ſort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to your wound, if I knew the particularities: but there is nothing more needfull to a ſingular evil, then general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; for according to the circumſtances, it changes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the face of the buſineſs. <hi>Roboald</hi> beſought her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him that he could not declare to her the cauſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs, for fear to be held too preſumptuous; that would would plunge him rather into deſpair, then any way bring him conſolation, eſteeming it leſs worthy of healing then of blame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabel,</hi> whoſe eyes were ſo piercing as they ſaw into his darkeſt thoughts, and into this breaſt covered with the cloud of diſſimulation, excuſed herſelf alſo to give remedy to an evil ſhe was ignorant of; and complains on the other ſide, of the ſmall confidence <hi>Roboald</hi> had in her; draws him inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to diſcover his deſign: juſt as when the birds are in love,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98576:70"/>
it is then they are taken with more eaſe; for by the different notes they warble to one another, they make themſelves fall into the nets and pits, finding the end of their lives where they thought to meet and enjoy their pleaſures; it will take <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald</hi> even ſo, who by an undiſcreet love goes to twiſt a cord to ſtrangle himſelf. It is not without reaſon that the Antients heve painted Love naked, by reaſon it can conceal not ſecret from the thing beloved. Who knows not how the perfidie of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> by the ſweet violence of love, drew out the ſecret of the ſtrength of generous <hi>Sampſon,</hi> whom ſhe brought after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to his fall and ruine? You will underſtand in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſomthing like that; for <hi>Roboald,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> after having given ſome fained excuſes to <hi>Iſabel,</hi> deſiring to make her believe that he loved the daughter of a Gentleman, a neighbour there by, without da<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to ſet his affections on a Gentlewoman; that true nobility was in valour, and in that he would not yield to whatſoever Gentleman; and that ſhe knew well that there was not any buſineſs in which he would not be led by <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> with as much affection as <hi>Herman</hi> himſelf would be, for the antient ſervants in a houſe held the quality of children: That the inequality of conditions ſhould not diſparage him; that ſince ſhe had dared to lift her thoughts even to <hi>Philippin</hi> that was her Lord to whom ſhe ought homage, he might well raiſe his to Gentlewoman; and that a faithful Lover ought to promiſe himſelf all things happy, ſince hope was the wings of love, and that love equalized Lovers; that Kings loving their ſubjects, have ſubmitted their ſcepters to their affections; that according to her judgment, there was not a more eminent greatneſs in love, then love it ſelf; and the greateſt amongſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98576:71"/>
Lovers, he that loves moſt. Imagine if this diſcourſe caſt not oil into the fire of <hi>Roboald,</hi> in a Country where Coblers make themſelves Gentleman, and the Gentleman Princes, by an humour that Nation hath. But when ſhe added, that if ſhe knew that Gentlewoman, and had but liberty to ſpeak to her, there was no ſort of good offices ſhe would not do for <hi>Roboald</hi> to favour his deſign; honoring his paſſion in another ſubject whereby ſhe would eſteem herſelf honored. It was now that this ſaucy Jailer touched the ſtars with his forehead, promiſing to his preſumption all that he had heretofore deſired rather hoped. Methinks I ſee the picture of the feeling of this ſoul ſwelled with vanity of his own deſires, well repreſented in the the rich Verſes of one of the Miſtreſſes of the Muſes of our <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>Although this man had preſumption enough to dare to love a perſon more high then his duty could permit him, yet the ſame love that gave him courage to fix his affections ſo eminently for his condition, took from him the daring to diſcover it, retained by that reſpectful fear that ordinarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies this paſſion; fear that proceeds of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98576:71"/>
of deſpairing of the object beloved. He ſeeks in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his fancie ſome artificial invention, to tell her that he durſt not utter, and to make her underſtand that he durſt not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>But the more he troubles himſelf to meet with it, the leſs he finds it; the confuſion of his thoughts being a Labyrinth from whence he cannot get out; His deſire is like quick ſilver, the more he preſſes, the leſs it is kept; the more he would gather, the more it diſperſes it ſelf. All know the combat of the Wind and the Sun, who ſhould deſpoil man; at laſt the ſweet rays of the Sun did that the bluſtring blaſts of the other could not. The more <hi>Iſabel</hi> importunes <hi>Roboald</hi> to diſcover his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with confidence, the more he hides it, and the more he enters into diſtruſts: yet when ſhe preſſes him leaſt, he burns with impatience to manifeſt it to her, not being able to die of a ſilent grief, being ſo neer his remedy. Love, whoſe attempts are not ſo hard, but as quick as thoſe of neceſſity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilſied his ſpirit, and gave divers means to make known to this Damoſel that which ſhe knew but too well already, but fains to be ignorant of by an artificious countermine.</p>
               <p>It is reaſon that Verſes, ſymbols of this paſſion that touches the heart, and Poeſie, daughter of this affection, come to the relief of <hi>Roboald,</hi> He is acquainted with <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But why do I ſtay in reciting his idle thoughts, which would be better buried under ſilence, then raiſed upon this paper? But to imitate the faſhion of Painters, that ſet off the features of a fair face by an extreme deformity; as alſo to throw confuſion in the face of thoſe that in their follies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98576:72"/>
theſe extravagances. I follow expreſly in this the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Nathan,</hi> that threatned <hi>David</hi> to manifeſt to the light of the ſun what he had committed in darkneſs, and to caſt his ſhame on his face, if by a confeſſion unfained and healthfull penitence he had not prevented the publication. Even ſo the Saviour of the world threatned to make be preached in the publike places the evils committed in the moſt private cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, when the ſecrets of the dark ſhould be manifeſted, and the counſel of hearts given to iniquity. And who knows not that ſhame and diſgrace is the certain recompence of vile Love?</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Roboald</hi> ſeeing that all theſe ſmall lights gave none to <hi>Iſabel,</hi> to make her know that herſelf was the idol to which he offers his thoughts; languiſhing with a ſilent grief ſo neer his remedy, and ſuch a remedy as ſeemed ſhould yield to his mercy with much facility; yet durſt not promiſe it himſelf, however reſolves to attempt by an art, after which he thought that neceſsity would break for him, as to the ſon of <hi>Craeſus</hi> the obſtacle that hindred his ſpeech. One day as <hi>Iſabel</hi> preſſed him on this ſubject, which was their ordinary entertainment, (for from the mouth proceeds the abundance of the heart) you will not believe, ſaid he, to what extremity hath brought me, ſhall I ſay my affection, or my folly? to an evil ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, having ſought all the ſtrangeſt remedies that humane thoughts can deviſe.</p>
               <p>The curious Maid conjures him not to hide his means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they gave no knowledge of the cauſe. <hi>Roboald,</hi> that ſtrove always to oblige her, and to make this obligation more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, made himſelf to be prayed earneſtly for a thing, of which he had more deſire then his ſuppliant herſelf. And to cheriſh this in her, You preſs me (quoth he) to diſcover a means that you lead as by the hand in the ſight of the ſubject of my paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then my ſecret will be no more a ſecret, nor my own; being diſcloſed not only to another, but to a woman, as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to contain it under ſilence, as a ſieve is to hold water. At which <hi>Iſabel</hi> makes a thouſand proteſtations of fidelity and ſilence; but they were oaths as light, as if they had been written on the ſands, or drawn on the waves. At which <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald</hi> fained to yield, and to remit his life with his love into the hands of this gracious priſoner. If your oaths, quoth he, ſhould not bind you with chains as ſtrong as they ſeem holy,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98576:73"/>
the intereſt you have your ſelf will bind you to conceal that I ſhall manifeſt unto you; for the part you have in heir whoſe face I will let you ſee, is ſuch, that you will be conſtrained to confeſs to me when you have ſeen it, that you have not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter friend in the world.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then, that having been juſt to that point to conſult with a Magitian of this Country, who as yet hath promiſed nothing good of the iſſue of my deſign, but on the contrary threatens me that the hope of a Nuptial bed will be the grave of my deſires; yet I have taken his propheſie as coming from the father of lyes; ſo that as the antient Oracles, I have believed one may better judge of his truth by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And indeed I have already known by ſome hopes, that if I perſevere to love with fidelity, there is nothing comes ſooner to its end then a conſtant love: For,
<q>
                     <l>Love uſeth to exalt the mind, and make</l>
                     <l>The Lower lofty things to undertake.</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Body</hi> from the <hi>Soul</hi> receives its flame,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Love</hi>'s the Torch that doth the <hi>Soul</hi> inflame.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Without then caring for theſe Funeral-predictions of this Sorcerer, I deſired him to give me a glaſs like to that wherein he had ſhewed me many wonders; and in which I ſee, when I pleaſe, her whom I honour, in the ſame faſhion and place, and in the ſame converſation that ſhe ſhall be when I would look to ſee her, as much to comfort my ſelf by this falſe good of her image in abſence, which is the moſt cruel torment that a ſoul can ſuffer that loves as mine doth, that is to ſay extremely; as alſo to learn by her carriage if my perſeverance may one day find ſome favour before her eyes, though not obtained without much difficulty, and with a thouſand oaths not to communicate this ſecret to any. You muſt therefore diſpence with me, courteous <hi>Iſabel,</hi> if I ſhew you not this glaſs, for fear to be forſworn, or it may be to take away the effect which is ſo ſweet to me, and the only conſolation of my eyes, if they ſhould be deprived of the object that is moſt pleating to them. For what do I know if the verity may not vaniſh at the ſame time that I ſhould make another participant of this ſight; or if this may be diſcloſed without ſome misfortune? or how ſhall I know that this Creature will have the belief that my
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98576:73"/>
extreme love hath given me for to ſee this face, that is not better preſented in this glaſs then in the affections of thy heart. And then there are certain barbarous words written on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of it, which muſt be pronounced before one can enjoy the ſight of this ſpectacle: And who can promiſe to a woman the courage to pronounce them without trembling and a ſecret horror?</p>
               <p>All this might plead my excuſe to you and ſhould perſwade you not to attempt ſo bold an enterpriſe; Let me die by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little ſecretly; I am to my ſelf a theatre ample enough; it is glory enough to me to have aſpired ſo high, and to ſee that in falling, it is from heaven I am precipitated. Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is incident to women; but we may ſay that their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity is far ſtronger then their apprehenſion; for to ſatisfie this deſire, we know they renounce all fear. Such appears <hi>Iſabel;</hi> for although a ſecret fear incited a panting of her heart, on the imagination that ſome devil ſhould do her hurt in being curious to penetrate into this ſecret; yet ſhutting her eyes at theſe conſiderations, ſhe left not importuning <hi>Roboald</hi> ſhew her this glaſs, aſſuring him ſhe had courage enough to look into it, and faith enough to pronounce the doubtfull words.</p>
               <p>Now you muſt know that all this imaginary fortil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge was but a pure invention of this man, to ſhew to this Damoſel the form of her proper face in this ordinary glaſs, deſiring to let her know by that, that all the charms of his heart proceeded from the beauties of her form. Now after many conju<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ations, and ſo ſtrong, that there was no more place of reſiſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out angring the ſpirit of (what ſhall I ſay?) curious, or furious <hi>Iſabel;</hi> drawing out of his breaſt the glaſs, of which the luſtre reflected on eyes of this impatient Maid; faining that it would have no effect if ſhe were not alone, and he to be retired. A certain terror ſeiſes her, fearing to be without help in the company of Devils; the firſt which figures a thouſand forms flying about her: which made her earnestly conjure <hi>Roboald</hi> to ſtay, or elſe to take again his glaſs; for already cold fear began to ſeiſe her.</p>
               <p>I doubted this, replies this man, that you would not have courage enough; and if you want confidence, how will you have belief enough? But here I diſpenſed with all by your ſelf, that ought to content you with the teſtimony of my good will.</p>

A relenting ſtays her in midſt of her courſe of this ſhe had ſo ardently purſued. Stay here a little, ſays ſhe, O <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald,</hi> to the end that I may regain my ſpirits, and have more aſſurance. I cannot ſtay, replied he, and give you the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction you deſire in this glaſs. Which he ſaid to make her more eager, to affirm his aſſurance, and to eſcape; not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could obtain ſo much of his own courage, he ſhrinketh enough to ſuſtain in her preſence the diſcovery of his deſign. They capitulated, and agreed, that <hi>Roboald</hi> ſhould ſtay in the next chamber, whilſt <hi>Iſabel</hi> pronounced the unknown words, and looked in the glaſs; and if any extraordinary terror ſeiſed her, <hi>Roboald,</hi> ſhould come at her cry, and give her all ſort of aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>He goes out; ſhe takes the glaſs with one hand trembling, where not ſeeing other but her face, ſhe feared it was for want of not having pronounced the words written on the back-ſide. With a faint voice ſhe tries to utter them, and ſuddenly turns the glaſs; and ſeeing but herſelf, thinks ſhe hath pronounced them imperfectly. Being now more couragious, ſhe recites them neatly, and cleerly diſtinguiſhes the ſyllables and letters. But yet ſhe ſees nothing but her face. She knows not what to thing; but then perceives ſome Verſes written round about the chafing of it, that ſaid thus:
<q>
                     <l>This Glaſs preſents the ſhape of her Perfection,</l>
                     <l>That is the Shrine of my moſt true affection.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This doth not yet ſatisfie her, till ſhe read on the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the orb theſe ſame:
<q>
                     <l>Could ſhe but ſee my heart as pure and faithfull,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>(SY ABELLE)</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>As ſhe ſees herſelf beautifull!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:98576:74"/>For, this Anagram was the little key that opened to her all this ſecret; it was choler that unſealed her eyes to penetrate into the art of <hi>Roboald;</hi> for that the laſt writing in form of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers deſcribed her name. But as there is no deafneſs worſe then that is counterfeited, ſo there is no ſtupidity more groſs then that that is fained, not to underſtand that ſhe knows very well. She calls <hi>Roboald,</hi> but with a tone and voice that had no feeling of haſte or aſtoniſhment, and gives him his glaſs: Go, go, ſaid ſhe; all your Devils are lyars, which give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but eluſions for truth: I have ſpoken the barbarous words with as much attention as was poſſible; and yet I have ſeen nothing in this glaſs, but that I ſee in that comes next to my hands; and then you add belief to this ſorcery.</p>
               <p>Madam, replied <hi>Roboald,</hi> and it may be it is want of belief that makes you fail of that you ſeek for; and you had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt perceived it, if you had as much faith as I have to ſee the fair effect of ſo fair a cauſe. Truly, replied <hi>Iſabel,</hi> it is here I ſee that Lovers are not only fed with dreams in ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but with falſhoods in waking; leaving ſolid content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to follow vain ſhadows. Go, go feed on theſe ſpirits and images as much as you pleaſe; methinks you wrong credit, and for a ſmall matter. Verily if you were an Idolater, I would freely ſay,
<q>
                     <l>If Pagans with dead Statues were in love,</l>
                     <l>Reſembling Gods and Goddeſſes above;</l>
                     <l>Who can blame me to love a living Saint,</l>
                     <l>And her effigies in my heart to paint?</l>
                  </q>
But being a Chriſtian as you are, I am aſtoniſhed to ſee you led after theſe ſuperſtitions ſo vain and ridiculous. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replied <hi>Roboald,</hi> is it poſsible that fortune hath ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, as it hath hindred you from ſeeing any thing in that Glaſs, after having uttered that fearfull words? Thoſe words that are to me as diſdainfull, as you eſteem them venerable, anſwered <hi>Iſabel,</hi> have no way ſealed my eyes, nor have ſhewed me in that Glaſs other then what I ſee ordinarily in my own, that is, my own face. And to let you ſee I have looked into it not fearfully, but attentively; it is true, it is one of the fineſt and cleereſt that I ever looked into.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:98576:75"/>Yet ſaid <hi>Roboald,</hi> you are ſome other thing then nothing; and you have not altogether loſt your time, in that you have contem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>plated your ſelf ſo well. I, but that is not all I ſought, continued <hi>Iſabel;</hi> for I have a glaſs of my own that doth me that office at my pleaſure, without art or inchantment. Many times it happens by the ſtrength of charms, replied <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boald,</hi> that we ſee that we thought not to ſee, and ſee not that we thought to have ſeen, that is, an eluſion, and the ſtrangeſt that can be told. For my ſelf, every time I look into that Chryſtal, I cheriſh the object I bear ſtamped ſo profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my ſoul; I feel my affections renewed and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the exceſs of my paſſion redoubling the exceſs of my fever.</p>
               <p>If this glaſs be ſo hurtfull to you, give me leave that I may break it, ſays this Lady; otherwiſe I ſhall think you are of intelligence with your enemies in the conjuration of your own ruine. I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Roboald,</hi> not to commit ſuch a ſacrilege, to break that that hath received ſo noble an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; for ſince it had but the honour to repreſent your ſelf, it deſerves to be eternally preſerved; and my ill is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to me, that that which other ſick men do to be healed, I do for conſervation of my ſickneſs. But is it poſſible that this Glaſs, from whence comes the fire that conſumes me, hath not inflamed you with love of your ſelf? Can it be, that your ſight that gathers all ſplendor, hath not incited in your ſoul the effects of a burning glaſs? You are far from the fortune of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> that became taken with his own form preſented in a Spring, that ſerved him for a tomb: yet Love of it ſelf is natural to fair Maids, witneſs the continual traffick they have with their Glaſſes. <hi>Roboald,</hi> ſaid <hi>Iſabel,</hi> you would by theſe jeſts flatter my miſeries, and ſweeten the rigor of my priſon, in which it is as hard to find me fair, as merry; for nothing alters, nothing ſo much changes beauty, as ſadneſs and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.
<q>
                     <l>Which like ſome cruel tempest doth (alas!)</l>
                     <l>Blaſt thoſe fair ſtowry bloſſoms of the face.</l>
                     <l>And as had kills the ſprouting flowers, ſo grief</l>
                     <l>Diſtorts my troubled breaſt without relief.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:98576:75"/>It to not that I do not much love my ſelf; for it is a thing ſo natural, as it is very hard to hinder, if one be in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection. But truly I am not yet arrived at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of folly, to love my ſelf in a Chryſtal, not to ſigh for an object I carry with me, and is as much mine as I am mine own.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Narciſſus</hi> loved, replied <hi>Roboald,</hi> lie took his own Arm for that of anothers; and in loving, thought of nothing leſs then to love himſelf: So that deſtroying by his own dilection with too much loving, he hates himſelf: And even like a torch that turned down, goes out With the ſame wax that gave it life; ſo this fabulous youth in ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though yet he ſaw not, was ſo poſſeſſed with his own raving, as he had no place in himſelf for himſelf. Let us leave theſe fables, ſaid <hi>Iſabel</hi> Yea, but fables, replied <hi>Roboald,</hi> hide many times under their ſhadowes the cleereſt truths: And what truth can be drawn out of theſe ravings? The ſtrongeſt that ever mounted into the brains of Poets.</p>
               <p>If ever <hi>Roboald</hi> were preſſed to caſt off the vail of his fears, it was here: For Occaſion ſhewed him the lock of hair on his forehead; and he thinks if he let it ſlip by his negligence, her deſpight againſt his baſeneſs would never ſhew him ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a face again. Therefore ſearching in his thoughts the ſubtileſt inventions that his paſſion could produce; and to imitate the nimble <hi>Galataea</hi> that the Poet ſpeaks of, which threw Apples in flying, and would hide herſelf artificiouſly after having been diſcovered; He leads this Damoſel by the clue of his tongue into a labyrinth of ſo many winding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, biaſſed, cover'd, double and of divers ſenſes, that now ſaying, and then unſaying, he enters, and goes out; he's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and again looſed; and ſtill fains not to ſay that he would ſay; with an eloquence, of which the art is not known but to thoſe that love, and dare not diſcover their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Now if the Aſſailant were quick, the Defendant was not leſs cunning. For crafty <hi>Iſabel</hi> ſeeing this beaſt taken, and ſtrugling in her toils, this Spider wrapped up in its own web; faining not to comprehend theſe diſſemblings, took an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſtime: for it was a pleaſure incomparable, that ſhe ſaw him now pale with fear to have manifeſted himſelf too much; now red with ſhame to unſay; anon inflamed with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98576:76"/>
deſire to pull off the mask of his diſcourſe; and then to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himſelf by the apprehenſion he had to diſpleaſe her; changing colour as often as a Camelion, his forehead being aſhamed of the variety of thoſe that make the Aurora ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear agreeable.</p>
               <p>At laſt having purſued this Stag, and brought her to a ſtand, keeping the change notwithſtanding all theſe hoverings, ſhe preſſed him in ſuch ſort by her queſtions, and the paſſion of this man brought him to that point, as he was forced to let fall the colour of his art, and to take off the vail of his diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, confeſſing there was no other inchantment in his glaſs but that of art; that he ſerved himſelf to make known to this Maid, to herſelf, and in herſelf, the ſubject of his bold affections. A Criminal that the torture hath made confeſs his irremiſsible crime, attends not with more certainty the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his death, then loſt <hi>Roboald</hi> that of the condemnation of his preſumption. But the ſtrong and cunning Amazon could not forbear bluſhing at this declaration; yet knows with ſo much art to colour her colours, that that which came with an inflamation of deſpight and ſhame to ſee herſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by a ſubject unworthy of her, was taken by this abuſed to promiſe him that he hopes by an inclination of good will.</p>
               <p>Thus he flatters his hopes by this cozening appearance. And although ſhe were as full as a Bee that hath loſt her ſting, yet this Maid hides the tempeſt that invaded her ſoul under the calm of her eyes, which ſhe had cleared on purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this preſumptuous fellow, making appear by this fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſort of joy in the midſt of deſpair and ſhame that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſeiſe on the heart of <hi>Roboald;</hi> who made bold by this eaſie acceptance that hid diſdain under a ſweet countenance, begins to perſwade himſelf, that ſince the water carries the ſtone, his perſeverance and fidelity might ſoften this courage, and make her condeſcend where his quality and birth hindred him to hope.</p>
               <p>This conjecture became a certainty in his thoughts; when diſſembling <hi>Iſabel</hi> made ſhew ſhe held for an honour; that which in her ſoul ſhe held for an affront and diſgrace, to be ſo religiouſly and reſpectfully adored by a ſubject whoſe merits ſhe eſteemed; faining to be angry to have been the cauſe of all his pains paſſed; excuſing herſelf on the innocence of her
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98576:76"/>
ignorance, not being able to divine that which was unknown to her, yet what ſhe had but too cunningly perceived almoſt from the beginning. Will you then truſt the apparent ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of women, that under a ſeeming childiſhneſs deceives the ſubtilty of the moſt cunning?</p>
               <p>In following this point, to bring this Jailer yet more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the ſnares where he was already altogether ingaged, and to draw the liberty of her body from the ſlavery of this heart, not only the teſtimonies to have his ſervice agreeable, but alſo to hold for an advantage this Match, although ſhe had it in horror. Raiſing his vertues above the defects of his birth; eſteeming herſelf more happy to marry one ignoble, that loved and honoured her, then one noble, that after the life ſhe had led with <hi>Philippin,</hi> could not have her but in diſdain and outrage.</p>
               <p>Imagine you what Lover had not been eaſie to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with theſe words ſo diſſembled; and if the courage of <hi>Roboald</hi> were not diſpoſed to belief of that that was ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to him, and let himſelf tranſported by his paſſion; ſince his interior inclination had intelligence with the treaſon without, to leſſen his ruine. All he can do, is to praiſe the bounty of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> in raiſing her even to the heavens, where his forehead touched already by the hope to ſee his pretenſions ſucceed, plunging into the centre of the earth by the words of ſubmiſſion and humility of a ſhadow, with which he vailed the arrogance of his deſign. But <hi>Iſabel</hi> faining to find ſo many difficulties in this enterpriſe, that it almoſt appeared impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it was now that he makes her to underſtand that there was nothing impoſſible to a Lover; that huge mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came plains to a courage lightned with this paſſion, that made valiant the moſt fearfull, and that all that oppoſed his deſire would eaſily be ſurmounted by his valour or induſtry. Alas, ſaid this cunning <hi>Amazon,</hi> I neither doubt of your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding nor ſtrength: but how will the inheriting pride of my friends ſuffer you to match with me, if they could not ſuffer to ſee me live with <hi>Philippin,</hi> who never poſſeſſed me but as his wife?</p>
               <p>At which <hi>Roboald</hi> propoſes to her to flie on the other ſide the Alps, and into the Countries ſo far off, that neither <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> nor <hi>Herman</hi> ſhould have either wind or mark of their retreat. Love, replied <hi>Iſabel,</hi> ought not to have his eye ſo hard tyed,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98576:77"/>
as not to take heed to his courſe; otherwiſe he will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in this blindneſs to fall into great and horrible precipices. Do you not ſee that it were to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſt our ſelves in truſt into ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and miſeries the moſt extreme that can enter into humane thoughts, and be loſt in thinking to be ſafe. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your paſſion and judgment: The priſon in which I am, of which your courteſie tempers now the rigorous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is more ſupportable then a calamitous liberty, full of infamy.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Roboald</hi> anſwered, But (Madam) if I diſcloſe the means that you may live the only Miſtreſs of your goods and houſe, will you promiſe to honour me with the quality of your Husband, and not to pay with baſe ingratitude the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I ſhall do you. At theſe words a ſecret horror ſeiſed the heart of this Maid, eſteeming that this barbarous <hi>Roboald</hi> would propoſe to her ſome parricide either by ſword or poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Oh, ſaid ſhe, what do you tell me here! I will rather rot and die in priſon, then go forth with ſo abominable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement; I will not like a Viper draw my life by the death of thoſe that have put me into the world.</p>
               <p>Madam, replied <hi>Roboald,</hi> you take on the left that which I intend on the right: I am not ſo unfortunate as you think, nor do I believe you ſo unnatural. It is a means that I know, by which not only your father and brother will give you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but will have nothing in more horror then this houſe, nor any thing ſo dear as to ſeek their ſafety by their flight, and to leave it free to your enjoying. It is then by ſome trick, anſwered <hi>Iſabel;</hi> but if it be as vain as that of your Glaſs, I perceive nothing of all this but laughter and miſery; for if my father but perceives that you uſe me not with all the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty he commanded, I fear he ſhould put me into their hands that are worſe then yours, and put yourſelf in priſon, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge you from his ſervice, and ſo your aſsiſtance in the one and other faſhion become inutile.</p>
               <p>Madam, quoth <hi>Roboald,</hi> there is no more inchantment in the ſecret I have to diſcover to you, then in my Glaſs; and yet the effect is as aſſured as that, where without ſorcery you have ſeen that you deſired to ſee. I have only to manifeſt a truth to you, by which you will remain Miſtreſs of your houſe; and without chaſing or violating your Father, he ſhall depend on your mercy.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98576:77"/>
I cannot comprehend theſe riddles, ſaid <hi>Iſabel.</hi> But then vile <hi>Roboald,</hi> to put her out of pain, puts himſelf up to the throat, as you ſhall ſee by the tragick hiſtory that follows. It was in manifeſting the murder of <hi>Philippin</hi> committed by <hi>Herman,</hi> by the perſwaſion and following the commandment of <hi>Pyrrhe;</hi> denying expreſly that he aſſiſted <hi>Herman</hi> and was Complice of this attempt, ſaying he was only teſtimony of this treaſon, of which he fained not to have been any way advertiſed.</p>
               <p>What became this woman when ſhe heard this news? what hatred was not formed in her heart againſt her Brother, and againſt her own Father? meaſuring it by the extreme love ſhe bore to <hi>Philippin.</hi> Suddenly like a Fury ſhe threatens their treſpaſs, reſolves to diſcloſe it to the Juſtice, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie at once to her revenge, to the hands of her Lover, the innocence of <hi>Eliſe</hi> and unfortunate <hi>Andronico,</hi> and to render by this means the honour to <hi>Scevole,</hi> making him of an enemy her protector againſt the inſolent ſollicitations of <hi>Roboald,</hi> to whom ſhe fains to be much bound for the revelation of this ſecret: She promiſes him that ſhe means not to hold; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that will being forced is no will; and that the oaths of Lovers and Priſoners do not ſerve but to deceive.</p>
               <p>Methinks I ſee in this Hiſtory that of <hi>Sampſon</hi> renewed by the treachery of <hi>Dalilah;</hi> which had no ſooner diſcovered the truth in what conſiſted the ſtrength of this inconſiderate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, but ſhe advertiſes the Philiſtines his enemies, who came upon him and bound him, covering him with a thouſand reproaches. For, faining ſhe would give an affright to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and brother, to the end that thinking of their flight, they might leave her at liberty and in full poſſeſſion of their lands; ſhe finds means by the diligence of <hi>Roboald,</hi> that like another <hi>

               <p>This writing found <hi>Scevole</hi> retired in his ſolitude, and plunged into the profoundeſt melancholy that he had ever felt. For on one ſide, the diſhonours of the world made the ſweetneſs of this life unpleaſing; on the other, the tediouſneſs began to take him; for there is nothing ſo ſharp as idleneſs to him that had always ſpent his days in the managing of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.

               <p>The Break of day, forerunner of the Sun, had no ſooner diſcovered to the world the divers colours of his breaſt, when <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Herman</hi> ſaw themſelves beſieged and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to yield.

At this their refuſal <hi>Scevole</hi> conjectures them guilty; their rebellion accuſes them, and makes them doubly Criminals, and as Murderers and revolted againſt the Juſtice of the Prince, a crime irremiſſible. This Caſtle is weak, and rather built for the pleaſure of the eye, then for the ſhot of Cannon. They are charged on the ſudden, unprovided of proviſions defenſive and offenſive; the gates are broke open,

and what ſhall two men do againſt ſo many? for <hi>Roboald</hi> and the reſt of the ſervants were rather a hindrance then any aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In the end they are taken; <hi>Herman</hi> being ſore hurt, and ſhot through the ſide with a bullet. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> uſes his ſword with incredible valour; crying, So ſtrong is the love of a father, that they ſhould pardon his ſon being innocent, he only being guilty of the death of <hi>Philippin.</hi> Wounded in divers places, he is rather ſeiſed and oppreſſed by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, then vanquiſhed.</p>

                  <hi>Scevole</hi> having that he deſired, makes their wounds be dreſſed, which were found not mortal. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> tells freely all, excuſing his ſon as much as it was poſſible for him. <hi>Roboald</hi> is accuſed as having been an actor, and ſees himſelf bound with his maſters, and conducted to the priſon of the City. <hi>Iſabel</hi> the Accuſatrix is in full liberty: <hi>Scevole</hi> takes her with him, in taking on him her protection. The proceſs was ſoon ended, for the guilty confeſſed their fault, without other rack but their conſciences. <hi>Roboald,</hi> which ſaw cleerly the act, and could not deny it, repents too late to have truſted this ſecret to a woman: His marriage-hopes are loaden with a funeral-deſpair, and his love rewarded with a ſhamefull death. For his two Maſters being condemned to loſe their heads, after having made an honorable amends publikely to the memory of miſerable <hi>Andronico</hi> and unfortunate <hi>Eliſe;</hi> He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to loſe his life on the gibbet, ſeeing himſelf bound and drawn by the neck rather for a puniſhment of the folly of his tongue, then the excution of his hands; for he had not lent to <hi>Herman</hi> in the murder of <hi>Philippin</hi> more then his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, being he was ſhot on the ground ere he had need to give any help to his Maſter. Thus God, admirable in his judgments, puniſhes this Traitor by the ſame treaſon he deſigned for his maſters; and gives him his end under the ruines of a houſe of which he intended to be maſter: like <hi>Icarus</hi> and <hi>Phaeton</hi> in the fable, which made their fall more heavy, as their flight had been preſumptuons.</p>
               <p>It is not my deſign to relate the particularities of this Execution, which may make all the world admire the heighth and depth of the judgments of God, which had permitted that Innocence made guilty ſuffered a death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved, by reaſons unknown to humane underſtanding; and then that inveſtigable truth had brought the guilty to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98576:79"/>
the ſame place where innocence for their miſdeeds had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the grief of a ſhameful pain. The honour of <hi>Scevole</hi> is ſeen entirely reſtituted, the memory of <hi>Eliſe</hi> honoured, as alſo that of <hi>Andronico. Scevole</hi> returns to the exerciſe of his charge. <hi>Pyrrhe</hi> and <hi>Herman</hi> amidſt their ſufferings teſtified ſo much of repentance and reſignation, that all were edified at their end, and praiſed God, that can ſo wiſely bring all unto their end, drawing from the evil of pain the health of him was hurt, as the theorick of the ſerpent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabel</hi> ſees herſelf at liberty; but by the confiſcation of their goods deſpoiled of all means to live, and reduced to an extreme miſery. And here the piety and pitty of <hi>Scevole</hi> ſhews it ſelf, that with a courage worthy of his name and truly Chriſtian, having already taken the Children ſhe had by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippin</hi> during the repudiation of <hi>Eliſe,</hi> takes alſo the Mother into his houſe, promiſing to uſe her not as an enemy and one that had been a flaw to his houſe, but as his own daughter, and to give her a portion as rich and more as her father could have done, in caſe any occaſion did preſent it ſelf ſuitable to her condition. Which made <hi>Scevole</hi> eſteemed of all the world, and almoſt adored by <hi>Iſabel;</hi> who coming to herſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with how many murders ſhe was ſoiled, her ill life having made void the earth not only of <hi>Philippin,</hi> but alſo of innocent <hi>Andronico</hi> and <hi>Eliſe;</hi> and which was more, her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural accuſation had brought her own father and brother to an ignominious death, that made her, beſides her own carriage, infamous for ever: Touched with a juſt grief and lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſhe renounces freely the world, wherein ſhe had known ſo many miſeries, experimented ſo many outrages, to retire to the tranquile port of Religion, which was into a Monaſtery of the Repentants, where ſhe's confined; interring alive her beauties under a vail, conſecrating her eyes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual tears, her body to healthfull mortifications, her breaſt to perpetual ſtrokes, her mouth to ſighs, her tongue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of her faults, and to ask pardon for them of God. There of a falling ſtone full of ſcandal, ſhe becomes a ſtone of edification, making appear the abundance of grace where ſin had abounded; there ſhe ſpent the reſt of her time religiouſly, there ſhe dyed holily. The mercies of God are pleaſed to be magnifi'd in the converſion of ſinful ſouls, that fly for refuge to the haven of grace, and aſſured port of a healthful penitence.</p>
